<div class="entry-content lettrine"><p><strong>this is my first real xanga entry. </strong>is that not exciting? so until i can get my blog up and running again i&rsquo;ll be storing my thoughts up here on good ol trusty xanga.</p>

<p>so since it&rsquo;s been such a long time between updates i&rsquo;m going to have to really wreck my brain to catch up. where to begin? let the wreckage commence.</p>

<p><strong>college workshops. </strong>how did i come out of it? pretty darn confused. and a whole lot more panicked. dear reader, i wanna get this whole college major thing down the <strong>first time around</strong>. too bad its like taking a half court shot at the buzzer when you&rsquo;re three feet tall in Game 7 of the NBA Finals with the score tied, the fans screaming and 50 million eyes watching your shorts accidentally drop to your knees. yeah, and you thought this was easy.</p>

<p><strong>running</strong>. here&rsquo;s the rules: left foot right foot left foot right foot.. and don&rsquo;t hurt yourself for heavens sakes. xc practice is going pretty well.. besides the fact i get burned during every workout and i&rsquo;m hurting after every one. no shin splints yet! which is quite surprising cuz i expected them to pop up without warning, kind of like bad 80s songs on the radio. i went up to run the trails just yesterday.. very refreshing, very beautiful views and very tiring. and the horse poop on the trails just made it even more.. aromatic.</p>

<p><strong>piano</strong>. well i started up again. the other day i was playing my new piece, beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pathetique&rdquo;. one thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p><em>how fitting.</em></p>

<p><strong>responsibilities</strong>. you know what i&rsquo;m learning? hey man, you can&rsquo;t do it all. i&rsquo;ve been pretty overwhelmed by things i&rsquo;ve taken on.. responsibilities that i can&rsquo;t always handle. committments that i havent necessarily planned for and shoot.. suddenly i&rsquo;m in too deep. trust me none of these things are bad by themselves but then they start adding up.. phew..</p>

<p><strong>hair:</strong> the fro&rsquo;s gone and my head feels so much lighter.. goodbye fro.. you were truly unforgettable. as well as unmanageable.</p>

<p><strong>R&amp;R:</strong> so on that note my parents suggested i schedule some relaxation time to myself.. (yeah where did that come from? i must be really showing it) so today, on a low tank of gas, i head out to the foothills to do some aimless driving. so i discovered some key things.. a) stevens creek does have a dead end.. at the cement factory b) the cement factory has scary security guards and c) you don&rsquo;t want to be at the cement factory.</p>

<p>so there i was driving 15 miles an hour up a windy road blasting and singing along to classic tuneskies (why don&rsquo;t people say &ldquo;tuneskies&rdquo; anymore? is it too cool for them?).. all windows down to increase wind drag and wondering where the next restroom was..</p>

<p><em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash; (here we go) &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</em></p>

<p>haha allright i&rsquo;m gonna be serious for a sec here. i decided to stop at the stevens creek reservoir for a bit, not really knowing why i did. i was sitting by the car and taking in the view when the verse &ldquo;be still and know i am God&rdquo; popped into my head. okay God.. what are you trying to say here? honestly how simple is that? i guess God just wanted me to stop and just.. <em>know</em> He was there.</p>

<p>we discussed this at the cell leader meeting this afternoon: how with the more free time we have, sometimes we subconsciously try to avoid God more and more. and i guess i was trying to paint God out of the picture.. i was trying to make loopholes.</p>

<p>okay i&rsquo;m just gonna go with my stream of consciousness right now.. lately i&rsquo;ve been feeling so detached from God. you know what i mean? when you&rsquo;re stuck in a guilt cycle and you keep failing over and over. soon enough you think you&rsquo;re not worthy.. you dont deserve to come into God&rsquo;s presence anymore. that is the number one lie that Satan plants in your head, and i fell for it. i was afraid to ask for forgiveness cuz i was afraid of breaking it again.</p>

<p>its awesome cuz in this small group a bunch of us are doing over summer we went over how paul describes <strong>freedom in christ</strong>. but the problem is that <strong>we don&rsquo;t believe it</strong>.. we keep ourselves chained to our guilt and beat ourselves up over how horrible we are. <strong>freedom</strong>..<strong> </strong>that&rsquo;s a pretty powerful word.</p>

<p>gah its starting to make sense to me right now.. i was stuck in this prison of guilt that i created for myself and so i found myself avoiding God&rsquo;s presence even more. and this whole time God was waiting with open arms, but stupidly i couldnt accept the fact that i was forgiven. and in essence, i&rsquo;ve been fighting this battle for years now.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>_man i was feeling (and even now.. i&rsquo;m still feeling) far from God. and that&rsquo;s how it should be.. we should be feeling empty cuz dude.. there&rsquo;s this totally undescribable feeling of being fulfilled when you&rsquo;re in God. i used to know what it was like.</p>

<p>they say you dont know what you got till its gone. well it&rsquo;s gone now and i&rsquo;m desperate to have it back.</p>

<p><em>these tears that plead for rain<br/>
</em>knocking on the door of heaven__</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m gone these next two to three weeks&hellip; i&rsquo;ll be going up to the DCLA conference up in sacramento then five days later i&rsquo;m down in Mexico doing some missions work with my church. i&rsquo;d really like these next few weeks to be of rediscovery.. my relationship with God has grown so stagnant and i&rsquo;m the one to blame. could you guys pray for me? i&rsquo;m going to need it, thanks =)</p>

<p><em>been so long since i&rsquo;ve heard your voice<br/>
been so long since i&rsquo;ve fallen in love<br/>
ignored you and tried to fly on my own wings</em></p>

<p><em>and<br/>
fell.<br/>
__<br/>
now its a love song for a savior i wanna sing.</em></p>

<p><em><br/>
</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br/>
that&rsquo;s my first knee-slappin down-home-goodness xanga post, and my has it been strange. thanks for getting all the way down here, now get out of here before that mug on the profile picture scares your little brother. i think i&rsquo;m kidding.</p>

<p><strong>gone fishin&#8217; &ndash; be back in a few weeks.<br/>
