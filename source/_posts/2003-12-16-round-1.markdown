i think i epitomized "**slacking**" last night, seeing as how i slept, ate, web surfed, spent three hours on a stupid flash intro to [http://www.g9labs.com](http://www.g9labs.com) and uh.. by then i had about an hour before school started to study for APCS. talk about your disfunctional subconscious mind. it's terrible, really =)

praise God, APCS final was bad but not as bad as I had been expecting. either that, or I've just bombed that thing even worse than I could ever imagine. in either case, it's over!  :cheesy:  :roll:

tomorrow is an AP english final i have no clue how to study for because mrs. baugher never addressed it in person. i'm serious. we never touched upon the subject of "finals testing" until monday when the substitute brought it up. methinks that "**screwed**" is the best word for it.

awesome seeing **daniel lui** back at home again, that guy has not changed a bit, ergo he is even cooler. hahaha UCSD slacking, that might be the school for me!  8)  after our prayer meeting he, i and adrian went over to guitar center to fool around on the nice guitars.. too cool.

i've been spending my time napping, i'm going to either spend the next two hours studying or fighting holiday traffic. ah, 'tis the season  ;)
