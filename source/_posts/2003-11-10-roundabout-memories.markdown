**and i found myself at the beginning again**, jumping through puddles without a care, water soaking black pants hemmed carefully and black shoes shined to perfection. the rain threatened everything four years had wrought: of the memories, of the elation, of the finality of the situation. of the senior, standing at the edge of the end and not wanting to go on. of the junior, wonderfully delighted with success. of the sophomore, struggling with the desire to move forward.

and it was of the freshman, jumping through puddles without a care in the midst of a downpour. all in the same place, the same time, savoring the feeling of the moment.

and i found myself at the beginning again.
