i'm tired of falling into these pits. i'm tired of being trapped by my own despair. i need hope, God. if you can't change me, who can?

i was feeling downright low today. You picked me up and said "That doesn't change anything."

You spoke today, thanks  :)  i'm gonna give it one more shot.

RIP **jeremy cooner**
