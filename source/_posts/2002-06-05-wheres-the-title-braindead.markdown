ugh.. i think i over-thunk. if that's a word. how awkward.

anyways, i spent much of today away from home.. went to early morning prayer/worship.. school till 3. after school i stopped over at dorothy's house for agape servant team activity (i have no cooking skills whatsoever lol)..

orthodontist appt at 4:15 cuz my retainer broke. yeah, it snapped. i dunno.. maybe i bit it in half or something. which is a very real possibility cuz i wear retainers when i sleep, and i'm also known to grind my teeth when i sleep too (too much stress i'm told). lol.. one morning i vaguely remember waking up in the middle of the night and having a chunk of plastic in my mouth. quite a strange feeling.

afterwards i headed to school for band awards ceremony. very very lengthy.. a whole lot of clapping involved. ever clapped for 1 and a half hours straight? well it was pretty close to that.

came home (finally) and ate dinner. i'm kinda getting hw started, kinda trying not to get hw started.

got a call from james lee telling me i'd made it to agape core team next year. i guess thats what i'd been expecting.. but wow.. its gonna be a big responsibility.. but its gonna be awesome at the same time =P

be praying for me guys.. that God would reveal himself to me in totally big ways.. that he'd open my eyes.. cuz as of right now i've been so lazy to work on my spiritual life its almost disgusting.

i'm also considering a missions trip into inner-city Oakland with my youth group this summer. ask that God would give me direction to make the right choice.

all right.. i really wanna finish up mr battaglia's assignments (that i'd conveniently neglected for a full 3 weeks). ugh.
