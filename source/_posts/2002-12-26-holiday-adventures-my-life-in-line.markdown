wow.. whoever said the economy's going down the tank has never been to fry's on the day right after christmas.

got there right on opening time (had to peel myself out of bed) and lo and behold.. the entire parking lot was full and the line into the door stretched around the building down a good couple hundred feet  8O  you can bet that was a great sight to see. inside it was like a madhouse.. shoppers running, people grabbing for items like there was no tomorrow. strange thing was that the items werent even all that cheap.. there were a few good sales here and there but nothing too special.. may have wasted about 2 hours of sheer waiting in line but oh well..

spent the rest of the day cleaning my room.. making some phone calls and then i wasted the next four hours working on the drummer boy remix. four hours of work for about 15 seconds of bad quality guitar piped in through the sound card. ah well.. yeah. i'm now looking for a rapper (the worse you are, the better :) ) for the final cut of the mix, if you're interested, please IM me =P

gonna go see LOTR2 tonight with the family.. is it good? we preordered tickets online and wow.. it's quite expensive for 2 adults 3 kids. this better be worth the money (as i hear it will be). good good.. i'm excited =P.
