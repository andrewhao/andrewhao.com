Betty is a homeless lady who has a bit more of a comfortable relationship with us. So oftentimes in the mornings she'll be fixing some breakfast for herself in the shared kitchen space that we have. Unfortunately, we've been noticing some food going missing lately and suspiciously show up in hers.

I saw her in there one afternoon with the other interns and I basically asked her in a really indirect, passive-aggressive way whether she was taking our food. Betty became super defensive and left. After a few more moments of registering what just happened, I walked outside and apologized to her for basically accusing her of something in which I had no proof.

I realized two things:



	
  1. I'm terrible with confrontation, and I've got to learn to be more direct.

	
  2. It's just food, for crying out loud. I am far less noble than I think.


And I have one question: how do you draw the line with your own boundaries and the needy in the world? How do you integrate God's kingdom and its infinite resources with the obvious limitations of yourself?
