winter retreat this year was something to really remember.. not only for the message we took back with us but personally for me.. a sense of unity and brother/sisterhood that means a lot to me. the fact that on friday, the jr/sr girls decided to serve the jr/sr guys lunch really blew my mind away that day. hahaha.. you guys really were awesome  :)

if there's another thing i must add.. the food was SOOO GOOD. the fact tha this was over the thanksgiving break meant extra stuff to give thanks for. namely.. food, food and food. oh man.. every single meal i ate till i was stuffed.. then i ate some more. now that's not very healthy, but hey.. you only get this kind of stuff once a year. go for it =P

got back home this afternoon and i was pooped.. but we had some lit project filming to go through. got some good stuff done, but i'm wishing we had some more progress done. tomorrow will be.. very very busy.

and i had to finish my homework tonight but all i ended up doing was sleeping it away. bleh. sometimes i wish my body would agree with my brain.

so hey.. that was my weekend. definitely worth it i'd say. definitely.
