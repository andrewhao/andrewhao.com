haha.. i toook a look at all my entry titles and they make me seem like some perpetually depressed dude. i'm not! well not usually.. actually i blame it on the hormones o.O

pops concert was today (and it will be tomorrow too).. haha the seniors in the wind ensemble put on quite a show.. i cant give it away yet, but it involves dancing, broadway, a strip joint (!), clowns and curtain calls.. whoever filmed today's perfomance I WANT A VIDEO

a bit apprehensive about next year. mark my words, i will become nocturnal (sleeping only during class periods). a fine idea.
