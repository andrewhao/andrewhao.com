simple statement: the less you blog, the longer your entries become. i apologize for everything below, please skip to the comic strip at the bottom. everything else in between is written for me. unless you really wanna.

life's been a blur recently, with friends, family, anticipating the new and reminiscing about the old. i'm meeting new people, catching up with the old, juggling responsibilities and commitments. bam bam bam bam it's been a whirlwind and honestly pretty overwhelming.

i feel busy, but in a good sort of way. good busy, unlike a few months ago when i was just swamped, sleep deprived and out of all sanity.

ever wonder if you can have too much of a good thing? i'm pretty sure i'm heading that direction. i need to slow down here, spend some time in silence.

the weekly revue:
exhibit A: **java night **was definitely a lot of work, and i was surprised how much we pulled off given so little time. spent two nights laying out a testimony packet, but by God's grace it came out well =) the night was laid back in the "cafe" with good food and good music. wow.. serina's set was seriously beautiful.

i'm always left feeling a little drained after events like these, either feeling light(hearted, or headed) or melancholy, wondering whether it was worth the effort. i think i'm starting to accept the fact that not every outreach or event can be perfect (psychiatrist's corner: andrew has a big problem with perfectionism) and well -- sometimes it's better to ditch the perfection and instead just seek after God's heart will and direction for whatever you're planning.

it's the mary-martha complex. mary just sat at Jesus' feet, while martha was doing all the stuff she thought would be right. there's too much doing in my life and not enough seeking. okay, off this tangent for now.

exhibit B: **it's time to grow up, kid** as now my dad just hands me house and yardwork tasks to handle. clean up your room like a man. mow the lawn, cuz you'll have to do it all the time in 10 years. scrub and repaint the pool fence, because you need to learn how to manage a house. we're opening up a checking account for you so you can learn to manage money. it's kind of exciting to be treated like an adult but kind of scary knowing there's not gonna be a safety net for you in your parents anymore. that's the real world, son. get out there.

exhibit C: **worship leading** has always been a struggle for me with my pride in my skill as a leader. these talents weren't even mine to begin with, so how can i lay claim to them? this applies to my attitude as a servant sometimes. sometimes i volunteer to help out with this or that not because i genuinely want to help out, but because i want to do it "the right way" or in such a way that i get some glory or whatever. messed, huh? :idea: God, i need you to put me and my attitude in the right place. more of me means less of You. my pride is depriving You of freedom.

exhibit D: **the website project and related responsibilities** sometimes you meet a project so large and exhausting you don't even want to tackle the first piece. this is one of them. well the beginning part was great, but i'm in the middle and i'm kind of stuck.

exhibit E: **new faces and old** and getting in touch with them again. summer means more time to chill, and i've had a ton of fun with you all. i miss it, definitely. caught up with a few specific people, especially in the aftermath of senior year and the distance it brought between us. that's a good feeling, reconciliation. angela wang was back for a week, hey it was fun to hang out with her, her loudmouthed ways (still hasn't changed) and her big heart. met a bunch of new people thru java night and college fellowship (especially the older ones) and talking with each and every single one of you has really helped me out with the confusion that i had about next year.

anyone remember andrew lin? old-timer clarinets will remember him. he hasn't changed, at least not that i could tell. great guy, i looked up to him so much in frosh year.

exhibit F: **agape core** may never have its annual chevy's dinner. not in 2004, at least =) you guys are great, just too darn busy!


okay before i end this too-long entry, i want to share something that's happening.
i've been **feeling a little weary** from all of the above in the aftermath of senior year (it was a tough year and i felt like i was overcommitted to a ton of committments and responsibilities, both in school, church and in other areas) and a couple of weeks ago received word that we were running **the call: extreme** again for another prayer vigil.

now honestly, setting up the first one was a bit burdensome. actually, setting up and planning any event is burdensome and sometimes can honestly fill me with dread! and honestly, some events turn out better than others for a variety of different reasons.

okay, i've gone over the mary-martha complex up there yonder, and i just feel a need to be honest: i was burned out and looking forward to a break over summer. no more figuring out what to do for Christian club meetings, no more mediating internal conflicts in leadership, no more feeling underpowered or undersupported or like you were the 'only one' that was working, no more retreat responsibilities (they were bomb! but exhausting, yo), no more feeling like the "lone ranger" Christian without accountability and support. no more writing dozens of emails a week advertising events, no more keeping track of people or asking favors of people and getting turned down by people. i'm going to stop there and i hope you can forgive the negativity -- those were all the side effects of leadership, and i needed a break.

so anyways i get a request to help out in this event called **The Call: Revolution** and it's basically a 48 hour prayer vigil held to dig wells of revival to the Bay Area. the first call vigil (in may) had positive results, but then i feel so wrong calling them "results". people came and passionately prayed their hearts out - and despite the small turnout, jaeson told us not to "despise a day of small beginnings", that the forerunners never had it easy but they would pioneer the movement. worst thing was that i understood it in my head, but my heart was secretly pretty down because of the low turnout.

and okay here's the cool part. i was feeling a little cynical (and tired) about the whole thing, but then God puts two fat **LISTEN UP **neon billboard signs in my life.

1. i'm at friday discipleship class with Peter and we're talking about what to do when leaders feel like their heart isn't in the work anymore. peter's response: quit and deal with it. get yourself right : how can you lead sheep if you can't even walk?

2. i had a serious "God moment" -- i was at the DYC supposedly to meet up with a group of people organizing a praise rally (i told you i'm overcommitted) but then i show up and realize too late it was canceled. anyways the DYC is locked up anyways and since i drove 15 minutes downtown i might as well use it well. so i figure i'll prayerwalk around DYC for a couple of minutes. take a trip to St James Park as well, interesting history there. it used to be town center of old SJ, presidents McKinley and Kennedy were both assassinated shortly after speaking at the square. it was also the location of the last mob lynching in the US. wow.

so i see this woman kind of staring up at the DYC as i walk past it again and she kind of looks familiar. i pass her, then something tells me to talk to her. so i ask her "are you here for the DYC?" and she's surprised because she is. and it turns out she's been prayerwalking around DYC too because it was locked. turns out she helps jaeson ma (they go to the same church) whom i'm also helping out with and she was with him in Hong Kong just a couple weeks back when he led revival events in Hong Kong. she was telling me about the depth of the passion and the miracles and the crazy stuff that happened on that trip, then she wonders "why can't this happen in san jose? i want it so bad!" that is exactly what has been on my heart this year. okay to make a long story short, she feels that in order for revival to happen, there has to be **prayer, and lots of it**. "and what you guys are doing with the vigil is just the beginning". okay, well more cool stuff happened in between and a lot of what she said just matched up with what had been on my heart recently. and in effect that was my God moment -- that God had a tall college girl i dont think i would have otherwise met to confirm that this vigil is the right thing to do. and so you know what, i'll do it not because i'm gonna suck it up, but because i wanna be a part of something bigger and greater.

and it's getting late and my sentences are making less sense to me. hasta manana.

and now the comic strip as promised:
