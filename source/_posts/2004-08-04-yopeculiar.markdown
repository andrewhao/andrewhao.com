let's turn our attention to what may possibly be the worst-designed product container over -- the yoplait yogurt cup.

as if it weren't named badly enough (yoplait, yoplate, yo, plate?) the french decide to give it a uniquely shaped container (read: terrible) that is something like a cone with the point lopped off. you know what i'm talking about.

now the problem is when you go to costco and buy 24-packs of these babies. and so when good things (24-packs) get mixed with bad things (oddly shaped cups), you get bad things. there is no way to stack a Yoplait cup, it just sits in your garbage can taking up all the space it wants in the world and gets stacked up with more and more of its siblings and soon enough there is a virtual french Yoplait monopoly on all the real estate in your garbage.

is that not shoddy thinking on behalf of whoever designed the yoplait cup? maybe it's because they're french. and if i actually knew any french people maybe i'd go easier on them.
