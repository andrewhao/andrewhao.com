I'm different. It's been about three weeks since the realization washed over me. I wish I had the vocabulary to tell you about it. But to tell you the truth, it's pretty foggy to me as well. That's why I've held off on posting out here--every time I think I have something distilled and clear in my head, something muddles it up.

Something's different. I can taste the change in my thoughts, my interactions with people and my personality. I don't quite like it. I feel older. More reserved. Slightly cynical (oh Lord no). Heavier.

I feel heavier, perhaps _wearier_. I bear bruises but I don't know where they come from.

Maybe I'll try to flesh it out in writing a little more in the next few days. I'll do my best to be transparent, but I'll probably hold back a little bit because of the nature of this medium. Please do ask me in person if you'd like a fuller picture.
