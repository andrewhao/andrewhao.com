a pretty good indicator of how busy my life is would be my computer desktop. the more cluttered, filled with odds and ends and unfinished projects, the crazier life must be. extend that analogy to my room, only without the dirty socks.




and it's only gonna get busier.. but i'm excited about it, i really am. this is what they call "fun work". now that i think about it, nobody calls it that.




praise night last night went pretty well, props to paul yan for piecing it together =) it was fun getting reacquainted with the drums, thanks to those of you guys that came, it was awesome to see your shining (or shiny?) faces. it's all good cuz God's good.




on a totally transparent note, i've been looking for love in the wrong places.. i'll be catching myself secretly wanting to be like the couples walking around school or wistfully daydreaming or any of that stupid, stupid, sappy stuff ![](http://www.xanga.com/Images/stunned.gif) and God's been telling me recently _wait, andrew. what do you need that i won't provide for you? do you think they have something you don't?_ and last night, that question turned into _can you trust in me to provide for you? can you wait and see that my plans are so much bigger for you?_




i'm trying to.
