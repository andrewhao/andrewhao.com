I have never felt so small, standing under the African sky. I wish you could be here to see it; sprawling diamonds falling out of the Milky Way, meteors arcing overhead over staccato lightning beats. Bolts. This moment feels like a memory, _déjà vu_ reversed again. Tomorrow, I will wake early and have coffee. Tonight, I cut circles in the sand as thunder sends me to a heavy sleep.
