AHHHHHH stressing out. i'm overwhelmed.
how can I feel so alone.. almost helpless.
hold me now, i need You more than ever.

you know those seasons of suffering that we prayed for yesterday? i had no idea they'd come so soon. so i'm gonna trust in You, cuz there's nowhere and noone else to cling onto.
