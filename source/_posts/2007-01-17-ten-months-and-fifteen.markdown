I am in the Berkeley prayer house in the "waiting room" and I am scribbling down pent-up thoughts that flow to me at an alarming pace. I write 20 bullet points and aim them upward in a "Dear John" letter. (Please skip the rest if emo writing makes you queasy).  


> "...  
6. Jesus forgive me for believing lies that my sin is impossible to overcome. That I can never have victory, so why try? I am so defeated.  
7. I AM SO FAR FROM YOU AND I AM TO BLAME (?)  
8. I pray cliches. It has been so long since I've prayed a heartfelt prayer...  
...  
11. FORGIVE ME FOR THIS CYNICISM THAT IS SUFFOCATING ME.  
12. God I'm afraid to say this but You don't mean much to me anymore.  
  
(a blank page)  
  
13. My heart doesn't feel anymore. I am so dry. No, more than that... what is it?  
14. I feel as I've searched hard and ended up emptier than before. Jesus, I come to You with nothing, God. I am so tired.  
15. I'm tired of running the race, fighting the good fight. I'd like a break, God. 5 minutes.  
16. It feels wrong to (say these things & feel good saying them.)  
17. I feel as if I'm right back where I started, God. Still bitter. Still empty, still disobedient. Just with some extra scars..."

  
Upstairs, they are praying, singing, jumping, laughing. "Come breathe in me, all my life, take over / Come live in me I will rise on eagle's wings." I finish my last sentence and find myself breathless.
