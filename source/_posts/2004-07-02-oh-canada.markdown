back from the land of the maple leaf, and it was quite the fun, putting up with strange parents and sometimes even stranger siblings; sometimes six days could not have dragged out any longer.

but before i elaborate in any further detail, it must be noted that ever since graduating i've been having more and more trouble writing anything down due to zero use of the pen or pencil. keep this up soon enough and i'll end up forgetting how to count to ten. higher education here i come.

and another memory that made me chuckle: sixth grade human growth and development when we all received those little sampler packs of Old Spice deodorant and we were all staring at them and wondering how you turned them on or however you were supposed to use those thingies. i never did.
