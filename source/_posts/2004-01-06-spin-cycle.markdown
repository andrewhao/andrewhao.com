i came out of break feeling quite refreshed.. (doing nothing, which made it so good) but this morning was quite a shock to the system as i slept through two quite-noisy alarm clocks and a timed radio that never went off  8O

so today at school i discovered (feel free to skip the list, it really doesnt matter):
a) there is lots of APEnglish stuff. due, and not due.
b) all-county audtions are this week.
c) music man practices are all throughout this month
d) vertigo goes into production for these next two weeks
e) de anza class starts today (and i'm beginning to think i'm in waaaayy over my head)
f) track started
g) i can't manage my time. not by myself, at least.

but praise God, my finals grades have me hanging onto slivers of hope.

i'm in the spin cycle again for the next two weeks or so. i'd really appreciate your prayers.
