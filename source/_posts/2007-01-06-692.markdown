I discovered Mike's last name a few weeks ago (and promptly forgot it the next day). I had been talking to him and he brought out his exit papers from his most recent visit to the hospital. There it was. He then showed me his Medicare card and I saw it again.  
  
It begins with an R. Mike R----. It's a shame that all I see are dashes.   
  
It begins with an R. In other breaking news, it has occurred to me that I could just ask him.
