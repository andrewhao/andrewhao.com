i hate it when my journals end up degenerating into posts about track and field, sleep deprivation and teen angst. which basically sums up the entire past two weeks' posts. let me give you what's been cliche twenty times over:

today i'm going to talk about **split personalities**, and how i feel like i'm two different people fighting for attention (kind of like two really spoiled kids) inside. and how i can get myself into a funk at will. but nope, i'm sure i've written about that sometime ago.

today i'm going to talk about how **track** is gradually deteriorating my body and how senior year's been so good to me; i can collapse on a bed right when i get home and sleep till 11PM, when i realize i have 23029 different unchecked items on the to-do-list. dah shuddup, you've done that too.

today i'm going to talk about how **my future** seems really uncertain. naw.

today i'm going to **thank** those people that've made a difference in my life in no particular order. this is the abridged list:

**mom&dad;** for being the most encouraging parents a kid could ask for. you are so understanding.
**peter wang** for really helping me understand the ins and outs of ministry and leadership.
**thomas chen** for all the alright-has and sup-cool-guys, and for sharing your passion for our youth group
**channing wong** of whom i've known forever, you're all grown up now ;-) and now my left ear is dead no thanks to your eflat soprano =)
**andrew yip** you showed me how the REAL chilling is done =) you see the potential in the younger guys and that's just darn cool. keep trusting that God's got your future in His hands.
**jack lei** remember super soaker battles at your house, asking our parents if we could go to each other's houses every darn week :-) you've just got that unique sense of humor that NOBODY else has.. thanks for pulling together bro-sis appreciation this year.
**college people** you are such an encouragement to me every time you come back and I see you guys have grown and matured like crazy. wish i could talk to some of you more, but that's my fault.
**howard huang** thanks for taking fat chunks out of your busy life to mentor me! those talks mean a lot to me.
**solomon wang** there is so much more to you than meets the eye - i wish everybody could see that =)
**ed sy** you crack me up, dawg. your work on the drama team is pretty awesome.. i'm always looking forward to your skits.
**daniel lui** you were a role model in so many more ways than you can imagine. thank you =)
**tiankai liu** hahaha where are you now? you'll never read this, but wherever you are (philips exeter academy, national math olympiad team) i can still remember you as the kid who made nerdage cool. this kid will take over the world.
**agape leadership** seung andrew christine bernice robert angela albert sophie tam jon jennyL jennyK i could not have asked for a more mature leadership team. i'm praying for you guys.. God bless yall =)
**small group** caleb ericL ericY ryan jason micah it's crazy encouraging to see you guys grow in Christ.

i gotta stop now cuz i've got a fatty APCS project that isn't getting thinner. i've left out YOU (that's right, YOU) and i apologize, IM me and i'll say good things about you, i promise =)
