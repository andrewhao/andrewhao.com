went tux shopping with chris alex jameson today, and had hua tag along as we hit up tux shops. my goodness, this whole process takes longer than i remember it did. hua sat on the couches and complained and whined about how long the guys were taking :) hold on while i suppress a maniacal laugh here; the tables have turned. this proves why many guys wildly flee in mass hysteria when the term "dress shopping" comes about. imagine how bad it is for a guy to go dress shopping with a girl. i would cry; or go to a corner, curl up in a ball and shiver.

but it's all good, i'm excited =)

"and i'm only gonna pierce my left ear
and i've been working on this mustache all summer long
and my favorite band will always be tears for fears
and i'm gonna wear a pink tux to the prom"
**relient k - in love with the 80's (pink tux to the prom)**
