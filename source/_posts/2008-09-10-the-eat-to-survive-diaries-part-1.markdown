_I'm writing this series to chronicle_ _my forays into cooking. For myself. Let's say that on the cooking scale of 1 to 10, one being a rock and ten being Rachael Ray, I'm a zero. Get ready for a wacky and wild ride into Andrew's gastronomical world..._

Okay, so I've got leftover pasta sauce from yesterday's spaghetti. I've got two slices of bread. And I've got some salad.

**How to live:**



	
  1. Toast bread

	
  2. Pour pasta sauce carefully over a slice of bread

	
  3. Wipe up the dang mess you made with the pasta sauce

	
  4. Top with the greens

	
  5. Dive in; close eyes and imagine you're eating a meatball sandwich.
