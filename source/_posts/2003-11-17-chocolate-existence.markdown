sometimes i stand in front of the food pantry wondering just where the jar of chocolate candies i saw yesterday went, knowing just as well as anyone that they're long gone, the glass jar long empty and the wrappers long thrown away and my stomach growls because it refuses to believe in the non-existence of these delightful goodies and i'm left standing there wishing, hoping, _willing_ that jar full of chocolate to reappear somewhere on the shelves that my eye has scanned fifty times already in the search of this elusive treasure hoping that somehow, somewhere i may have missed it and it will reappear somehow on closer reinspection, so i search closer still, standing there in front of the pantry, twelve o'clock when i shouldn't be eating at all, wondering just where a certain jar of chocolate candies could have disappeared to.
