yes, it's sunday night. yes, i happened to waste all of this afternoon loafing around, playing games and messing around with the guitar.

yes, i think i should've started my math.

anyways, i think tomorrow won't be too bad, as long as i do decently on my math and history finals. it's tuesday's finals that got me real worried though. the subjects of chemistry and..

**spanish?**

yes, folks. my old nemesis. spanish 3 with senor molino.. haha.. i hope that i scored enough brownie points with him this semester so as to sorta counteract my forseeable D+ on his final (i'm being totally serious here). maybe he'll give us all A's cuz he's retiring. or, maybe he'll give us all C's. not like he cares xP

does anybody wanna go out to lunch tomorrow? no, i wont drive you.
