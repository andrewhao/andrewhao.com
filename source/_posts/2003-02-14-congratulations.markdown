congratulations mr. hao. you've completed your first all-nighter. and you're not even done with your homework yet.. aint that pathetic?

so why are you writing blog entries?

and why am i writing rhetorical questions to myself?

well this week really was trial by fire for so many of us.. honestly i felt the pressure so much more this week than any other week and i know you guys all did as well. congratuations.. we've survived, although maybe not in one piece.

i've seen so many hurting people here at lynbrook.. walking around in facades that dont belie the true turmoil and pain and circumstances that lurk beneath. the perpetually cheery faces that collapse under the emotional toil and the academic barrage. souls withered and dried and indifferent to everything.. the social outcasts that try to hide from public scorn. the tears that flow are testament to more than a broken trust, they are of a broken soul. the hurt. the anger. the _weariness_..

it doesnt have to be like this.

we need You, God. only you can rain down your love and healing again.. this campus needs You. badly.
