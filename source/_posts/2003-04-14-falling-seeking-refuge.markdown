arrr.. i've been stressing way too much lately.

you know.. over the little things. over the things i really have no control over. but being the major control freak i sometimes love to be.. i can't help but worry. and stress. and grow white hair.

and i guess today during my devos God really hit me with something so true. "andrew, why can't you trust Me? why won't you let go?" and i stopped and i wondered the same thing.

giving up and living your life for God is something that we all talk about but its SO TOUGH to do.. and i've been having a pretty hard time of it lately. when the rest of the world presses in on you with academics and relationships and college and your future.. honestly God just gets lost in the picture.

but doing everything by myself just confuses me. depending on myself only frustrates me. i've been feeling emptier and worse off than before.

gsgninE (10:48:07 PM): God's all "dude andrew.. chill.. i've got it"
gsgninE (10:48:14 PM): hahha
gsgninE (10:48:26 PM): but yeah.. still its tough
LuMpY CowLicKs (10:49:10 PM): agreed
LuMpY CowLicKs (10:49:29 PM): haha..
LuMpY CowLicKs (10:49:34 PM): God is so hip
LuMpY CowLicKs (10:49:43 PM): with the "dude" and the "chill"
LuMpY CowLicKs (10:49:43 PM): hahaha
gsgninE (10:50:09 PM): worrrrd

so yeah.. that's really what's been on my heart tonight.. just thought i'd like to share it with you.
