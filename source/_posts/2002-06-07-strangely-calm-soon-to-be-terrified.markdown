welllll its a friday night and i can happily say this:

im not worrying for finals.

welllll it'll soon be sunday night and i'll be saying this:

that's when i'll be worrying.

haha.. well today was pretty interesting.. bombed my chem test (everybody did, so that makes it all good).. said goodbye to the seniors and got em to sign my yearbook (i'll be going to their grad anyways). in math we did nothing.. literally nothing and that was great. haha.. i won a "Samurai Award" for my lit minibook.. that's what i stayed up till 5:30 for. yep. i think all my blood sweat and tears paid off. lol.

last dance of the year tonight and i didnt go.. oh well.. i dont think i really cared much for it. heck, i dont really care much for dances, period. haha.. i bet the only dances i'm gonna end up going to are formals and proms. sounds like a plan.

some people dont understand when to stop prying (aherm jon kang)

Azn00coW: so just tell me
Azn00coW: i want to see how pimp u are
gsGnine: lol.. i'm no pimp okay?

sigh.. mucho summer school complications are coming up. i ended up signing up for de anza a bit too late (gonna be registering the 24th, second to last day).. so i dont think my chances of getting into math1A are too great.

secondly, i was reviewing the course description and i realized that we already covered most of it in precalc already.. i figured that i should be doing something a bit more challenging. now i feel that i should be doing math1B.. which brings me problems.

1. i need to simultaneously register at foothill.

2. i need to get confirmation to enter Math 1B at both foothill and de anza.

3. skipping a prereq class is **extremely** tough, according to channing.. lots of hoops to jump through.. sigh.. i hope my mom can get a parental override or something.

4. if i don't have confirmation, i need to get confirmation to reg for Math 1A at foothill.

5. foothill's really really far away.

that's my dilemma in a nutshell.. im gonna be praying hard about it cuz there's not too much i can do at this point.

well.. im gonna get in the last of my relaxation in today (jedi knight 2 =) then tomo its battaglia time with my friends the computer, printer, glue stick and an xacto knife.
