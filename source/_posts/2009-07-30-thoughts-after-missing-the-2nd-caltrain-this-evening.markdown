It's a strange life, this is. I'm standing at the Caltrain station, watching the 195 leave me behind in the dust, watching a long, slow whistle escape from the engine train and surround me with its delightful irony. Tonight I'll get home an hour later, maybe by 1AM if I'm lucky.

I wobble off my bike, sweaty and more than a little frustrated, and stumble over to the nearest bench. There's nobody to curse but steel, diesel, and a heartless timetable. I kick a cockroach; it rolls over and scurries away. Hrmph. Still grumpy. Okay, I'll vent on Twitter. Bad idea Andrew, broadcasting angst over the Internet is a cultural faux pas (but look at what you're reading, ha!).

Life is just _really different_. I just realized why--it's become much harder to attach meaning to things anymore. I wake up, I catch the J bus, I walk into work, I fix bugs, draw mockups, code features, grab lunch, take a run, catch the bus, go home, watch a movie... and do it all over again. Life's more routine. My identity suddenly doesn't feel as much a small-group leader, or a mentor, or a student, or a friend, or a musician any more as it is mostly now as a... what?

It's a warm summer evening here at the Caltrain station. I sit here for an hour and take in the rhododendron breeze. Forced to stay, and sit, and watch, and be.

A blind man slowly teeters up to the fare booth and orders a ticket. "WELCOME TO CALTRAIN!" the lady with the digital voice blares, and the blind man, startled, silences her with the powers of Braille. A cockroach scurries underfoot and heads for the light.

I close my eyes and listen to the rhythms of the city: the groanings of the train tracks, the soft rush of traffic, people conversing faintly just over the other side.
