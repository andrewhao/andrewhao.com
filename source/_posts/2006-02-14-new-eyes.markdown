CRAZY.

All these loose threads and strands are coming and being tied together.

WOW CRAZY.

God's showing and teaching me things all over again with new eyes. Like falling in love with somebody you've never known, until now. The half-analogy is like living with your grandparents in the same house, but finally starting to ask and talk and learn about them. Um, maybe that's not so good of an analogy.

SO NUTS.

This post could not be any more ambiguous.

**I'm noticing a growing hunger** for beauty in my life right now. It's lockstepped, rigorous, scheduled and downright suffocating here. I want freedom, I want beauty, I want color & truth & pain & release & Grace and everything in between. I sound like some bohemian hippie right now, I blame it on Berkeley.
