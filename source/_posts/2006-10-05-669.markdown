Is it strange that I don't listen to the lyrics of the songs I listen to? I've been listening to the Fray CD for about two hours now and I don't remember a single refrain (except from that overplayed "How to Save a Life" single). Of course, this is whilst studying. Maybe it's just my preferred method of music consumption: ambience over cognitive brain-food.  
  
I wonder what I would come up with if I actually plumbed the depths of the songs I listened to. Beauty! Eloquence! Crass irony! Tired cliches! Rivers of emo tears!  
  
I wonder if my subconscious is processing any of these messages. The masscomm major in me would have a field day.  
  
(There is a moral to this story.)
