my trip this morning to the dentist had "bad day" written all over it. walking into the office, still a little groggy, i'm led to the chair as i expectantly glance at my dentist (dr. tong) to walk over to begin the (always) painful cleaning process. he smiles at me and instead introduces a new lady. "this is dr. lin," he says. "she's training and she'll be cleaning your teeth for the day."

immediately horror stories began to fill my mind. what if she doesnt know what she's doing? what if this is her first procedure to perform.

okay, granted this is just a routine CLEANING procedure, but bear with me here. i'm scarred for life by those high powered drills and whatsits and weird solutions being sprayed on teeth and in areas in your mouth that you never knew you had. in short, nobody really loves to go to the dentist. especially not me.

anyways, before i can react or say anything, she smiles and sticks what i took at first to be a harmless pick into my mouth. unfortunately, this is no ordinary pick. i hear a high pitched whine. this could be bad...

well.. to make a long story short, it wasnt all that bad. i didnt gain any more of the zillion cavities i already had (a noteworthy achievement) and the most discomfort i got was a few sore gums and a really dry mouth during the procedure. haha i make this sound like surgery

went to tammy's for a picnic/potluck thingy for lunch today.. haha it was pretty cool. just kinda hung out.. talked.. ate (thats some majorly good pizza) and watched _the matrix_. ahh i've forgotten how amazingly good it is.. so many meanings on so many levels. tim cheung (tammy's cousin and all around cool guy) came over and it was cool talking to him again.

anyways i'm off on a 3 day ski trip with peter/thomas and the guys.. i'll bring back a fully-detailed, five page doublespaced report MLA format when i return. till then.. =D

oh wait, here we go. here's what you guys were all looking for. MEANINGLESS PHOTOS!
