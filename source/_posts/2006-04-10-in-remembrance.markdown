I don't have many words. I don't know if I could have words. I wish I had them. It's always about having words.

You were kind of an awkward guy, but you didn't let that stop you killer sense of humor.

[out of the blue]
Azn00coW: you have the flamethrowers that shoot chocolate hundred dollar bills?
gsgninE: i do have the sheep that can eat gourmet broccoli heads
gsgninE: hahaha keep it going
Azn00coW: you have the go kart that turns into a stretch limo with plasma screens
gsgninE: i do have the ford aspire with the ten-inch spoke rims, faux sheepskin back seat and dangling smiley face doll from the front mirror
Azn00coW: do you have the filing cabinet that has a cup holder big enogh for the 10 gallon slushies
gsgninE: i do have the cardboard box that doubles for a time machine on those slow days
gsgninE: ahhahaha nice=)
gsgninE: dang jon.. convos with you are always fun
Azn00coW: i told you
Azn00coW: its all the time spent on internet
Azn00coW: and thats where i got the shoes that dig for diamonds

Yeah, I'll admit it. We weren't too close of friends. We'd kick it in Molino's Spanish 3 class and make jokes about the old guy. Is that how I met you? We kept up the zany IM convos.

We found out you had leukemia, the closing months of your senior year. I'd moved onto UC Berkeley by then. Oh my God. You stayed home for the next seven months to receive treatments.

I watched a community of people gather around you and support you. I could see that they loved you.

You asked me to hang out over winter break. You asked me to come over and bake some frozen pizzas. Haha, so I came over with some 10 dollar Boboli and more than a little tentativeness for what the year I'd been at college had done; not seeing you since you found out about your condition.

And it wasn't awkward at all. Your parents were at home, milling about and amiably making conversation with me (a complete stranger to them). You finished up your Starcraft game, we went to the living room and chilled watching MythBusters on Discovery Channel and playing some Duck Hunt.

You didn't make much conversation. But maybe that was okay.

Jon.. did you know I set one of those alerts for you on AIM that let you know when a buddy signed on? I always meant to talk to you more. I regret I always told myself I'd do it later.

I went to your Marrow Registration drive, last week. It was the least I could do. Everybody was there Jon. I wished you were and I could have exchanged a few words with you.

Then yesterday Dorothy told me the news.

"Oh my God. Oh my God."

This was the last [photo you took](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonkang). It's fitting.

I have no words. Oh, my God.
