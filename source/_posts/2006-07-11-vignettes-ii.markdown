He is speaking, much too loudly, but nobody is listening. Slowly, deliberately, enunciating every word. He dangles his arms over the scratchy seatbacks, tossing his right leg over the neighboring seat and continues his conversation with the world. He is a ragged man, with tatters for clothes.  
  
"It's because I'm black. Do you hear me?"  
  
Nobody's paying attention, but everybody's listening. The man on his left is buried in his Chronicle, the woman to his side is engrossed in her cell phone conversation. But their stillness gives their attention away.  
  
"Do you know what they did to me in prison?"   
  
The gentleman seated ahead of him gives a little cough and leans to mumble something to his partner. She makes no acknowledgement of his gesture.  
  
He is not drunk. He is speaking intelligently. A little smile; the motion of the train rocks his body loosely back and forth. And he continues, content in his conversation with the world.

He is there again, but in different form at the bus station, with big roll-up flimsy shades and an eerie confidence about him. "Shalom, shalom," he cries as he approaches two aging ladies seated on my right, "you two look beautiful. You look absolutely beautiful." The 40 bus arrives just in time and they spring out of their seats in a harried rush reserved for youth.   
  
He continues his colorful monologue. It sounds like a speech, and it sounds carefully rehearsed. Undoubtedly he takes great pleasure in doing so, reciting line after line, chuckling to himself in measured intervals.  
  
I cannot look into his face, because I am fearful that if I lock eyes with this man he will engage me.  
  
In the stillness he has an audience. Perhaps this is why he speaks.
