So being called in for jury duty isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be.

Let's put aside the fact that I wasn't actually selected to be on the jury, but they called us in anyways today for the selection process.

Okay, back up. So somewhere 'round November, just about two weeks after I register to vote, my mom phones me at school to tell me I got my jury duty notice. "Tell them I'm a student and I can't make it," I tell her, crossing my fingers and hoping I can get out of this situation. And she does, and all they say is "Fine, we'll move to you the week of your winter break." Drat. I fish around school for tips on getting out of this civil obligation. "Tell them you took Political Science at Berkeley," my Political Science GSI told me, "and that you absolutely mistrust the legal system."

So all of this week involved being slave to my browser and hitting the "Refresh" button on the Jury Duty notice website. It mocked me, never selecting my juror group and telling me "Please check again at 5:00PM."

Thursday at around 12:30PM I check the site. "Your juror group has been selected to appear," it tells me, "at 1:00PM."

One look at my watch told me that I could make it on time, provided I could break a few traffic laws or fly. Or teleport. So I figured being late for jury duty was along the lines of a major crime, made like cytokinesis and split (I've still got some bio jokes left in me).

The Santa Clara County Main Courthouse is much like the Main Jail. They're both concrete-block buildings and have metal detectors up front. And I managed to walk into one accidentally before the other. But I digress. So I walked into that building with an air of supremacy, hoping people could smell the "Potential Juror" scent I put off, walked straight and tall. Heck, I even put off shaving so I could look older. Actually that's just cuz i'm lazy. For those curious to know: **here's what happens:**

A. You sign in at the front desk. The receptionist will give you a disdainful look for being 25 minutes late. You will get your parking ticket validated, your jury duty notice looked over, and your nose hairs trimmed. You are sent into:

B. The Jury Assembly room, basically a glorified hospital waiting room with magazines more out of date. People of all ages and races sit, and it is a glorious feeling we are united as human beings sacrificing for public service, human beings all somewhat wishing we were somewhere else. Thirty minutes will pass and the lady over the intercom will call your Jury Panel Group into...

C. The Judge's Chambers. Oh shoot, this is the real thing. Wooden walls, plush leather seats, armed deputies, raise-your-right-hand-and-repeat-after-me's. Any sense of disrepect I carried before coming in is erased because well, I'm a little in awe.

I sit in with Judge Joyce Allegro. She is probably forty-something with serious eyes, the robe and the don't-mess-with-me voice. All rise.

So there's about twenty of us and they call 12 up to the front row, sitting across from the two lawyers. We are asked questions about whether we can ignore our biases in such-and-such situations. We are asked to tell things about ourselves, our backgrounds, any relationships with lawyers, police officers, educational levels, whether we have been victimized or convicted of a crime. Such and such, it takes awhile. Then the interesting part. It's like a game of... I really dunno. Roulette, almost. Each lawyer gets to choose a juror onto the jury panel, then they take turns booting jurors off, replacing jurors who are still not seated. It doesn't make sense the way I've explained it, but it's kind of entertaining.

Me? I lucked out. Their round of Juror Roulette ended with the girl sitting to my right. The jury was finalized, she was picked as the alternate leaving me... free to go. Whoa. Phew.

So that was my brief look into the justice system. What was super interesting was the case: the defendant, a convicted rapist, had been convicted of failing to register his new location according to Megan's Law. He had chosen to represent _himself_. Sound familiar, fellow Berkeley Poli Sci 1 peeps? Gideon's Trumpet, Reloaded for the 21st Century. The man had waived his right to a lawyer to defend himself. The prosecuting lawyer had to make his point - "Will you hold a bias of sympathy toward the defendant?" "Will you hold me to a higher standard because the defendant has chosen to represent himself?" Very, very familiar, and interesting to see how the effects of _Gideon v Wainwright_ are carried out today.

Second interesting thing was a little more personal. You go into a jury panel thinking you can discard your human biases, yada yada yada because you are an upright, moral citizen. But then the defendant is introduced as a rapist and then, whoa, you look at him differently. You don't look him in the eye. You see him more critically and at some point you wonder if you could really be unbiased. Just some things to chew on.

Okay, so moral of the story is, I'm eating too much and getting fat. Good night, folks.
