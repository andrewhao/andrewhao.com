**So **it's hitting eight, the sky is blackening and I'm standing outside the garage just sucking in thick, cool air (smell the summer?) and the one million thoughts and emotions running through my mind are slowed down to one and it's the beauty of being

still.

**The** funny thing about it is that I think I'm supposed to enjoy this moment, like God was setting up this past year to have me humbled and renewed and called out and totally stretched and grown. Suddenly it's like having the camera zoomed out on you and you're watching yourself relive the hard times and the good times and you finally see the bigger picture.

**So I'm** drinking this moment of almost-summer, of reluctant farewells and hellos (almost like the changing of seasons). There's something powerful in the way it fills me up, and I'm that little boy watching closely at his Daddy's hands.
