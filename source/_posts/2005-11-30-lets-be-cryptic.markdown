"How are you?"

I'm in this state where I
answer best in abbreviated
hiccups

I don't know, somewhere between
tired thankful weary
electrified

Very peculiar, this is and
  I don't expect it to last long.

I don't know how to feel anything
anymore, not that
I ever knew how to
but I've never experienced emotion
at its heartwrenching
fullest? Do I even want it that way?

Hum. I'm at an interesting place right now, but I don't know how to describe ----- it.
