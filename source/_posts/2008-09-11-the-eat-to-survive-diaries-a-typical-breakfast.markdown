_I’m writing this series to chronicle_ _my forays into cooking. For myself. Let’s say that on the cooking scale of 1 to 10, one being a rock and ten being Rachael Ray, I’m a zero. Get ready for a wacky and wild ride into Andrew’s gastronomical world…_

Okay, so it's morning. I've just come back from a run. I'm _huuuuungry_. Let me give you a glimpse into my morning meal, beginning with the cereal:



	
  1. Open up nearly-empty milk carton. Pour into bowl.

	
  2. Shake in some cereal.

	
  3. Eat.

	
  4. Dang. Milk ran out before the cereal.

	
  5. Pour in milk from pretty-much-empty milk carton.

	
  6. Eat.

	
  7. Dang. Cereal ran out before the milk.

	
  8. Shake in some more cereal.

	
  9. Eat.

	
  10. Milk ran out before cereal.

	
  11. Rejected! There is no more milk from now-empty milk carton. Miserably chomp through the rest of cereal.


Onto the fruit portion of our competition:

	
  1. Eat like six plums. Why plums? You thought they were the best fruit-per-ounce value at Trader Joe's.

	
  2. You don't like plums very much.


Finishing off with toast:

	
  1. Still hungry. Let's try toast.

	
  2. Pull out week-old bread from plastic bag.

	
  3. Cut out as many moldy parts as you can find. Pray you found them all.

	
  4. Throw em into toaster. The heat should neutralize the mold, right?

	
  5. Spread jam with dirty knife in the dish rack.

	
  6. Eat. Remind yourself to thank the wonderful souls who invented toast.

	
  7. Clean up the dang mess you made in the toaster and all over your table.


I want cereal again. But there is no more milk.
