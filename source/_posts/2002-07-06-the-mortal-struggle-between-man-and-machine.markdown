so our youth group (CIA) is sending a bunch of people over to mexico this summer for a missions trip (taht just happens to cost a lotta $$$). what's a good solution to this? of course, hold a garage sale!

so we collected a buncha boxes of donations from the youth yesterday and some of us went over to junny (kuo)'s house (where the sale was gonna be held) and helped price and mark items. i can't say i helped much.. along with eddie, brett and vinny (haha running out to safeway at 12 for some day-old fried chicken) but we did manage to get em marked. there were lots of cool stuff too: even a dreamcast w/ 2 controllers and a VMU and games and stuff.. drool*

but honestly speaking, i didnt expect many people to come. heck, i wondered if we'd even sell a quarter of what we had. i mean, who cares about a dinky garage sale?

a **lot** of people, apparently. i forced myself up at 8AM to get over to the sale, only to find a frazzled (and tired-looking) junny and priscilla handling some early-bird-garage-sale bargain hunters. people, these guys are hardcore (given the fact that it was an hour before the actual sale was to begin.) i never even knew that garage-surfers existed till now.

my dad and i went to fry's afterwards to go buy a motherboard/CPU combo to upgrade our junk (IMHO) computer. it woulda been perfect.. if only:

**a) the fan fit. **somehow the fry's salesman convinced us to buy a crazy monster-double-grande-deluxe-go-warn-mamma heatsink + fan combo for the cpu. problem? it barely fits under the power supply. and all its airflow is cut off. hm..

**b) i hadn't been so stupid. **lets not go into details but i managed to fry my hard disk. yes, whoopee, shout for joy and all that. you go, andrew. yay. i love the smell of melting plastic in the afternoon (and i love to watch smoke slowly billow from my computer case).

oh well.. what can you say? hehe i learn from my mistakes. bah.. oh well. after church, some of us from CCIC are gonna meet up with some 5HOC guys to play a lil friendly game of bball. last time we brought more than enough ppl so we were able to stay a little more energetic than the 5HOC guys. this time.. we're definitely running low on "ballers".

gsGnine: hey dont worry

gsGnine: man i sound like my dad
