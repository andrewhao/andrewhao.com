seems like you could just stare into your computer monitor on early mornings like this, doing nothing besides... doing nothing. i keep telling myself i need to get my sorry rear into bed but at the same time dreading having to move. so i dig up random little tasks and pointless things to do on the computer.. denying the reality that, yes, you do need to go to your room sooner or later...

so we went to see the musical tonight - _Annie Get Your Gun_. wow... i was told that it was good but i was never expecting it to be that good. i have a lot of respect for everyone involved.. i guess that's just what you expect from putting in all that work and effort into the production. rewarding? i hope you guys find it so.

and now my thoughts are melting into a jumbled incoherent mess because it's now 4:40AM and i'm starting to lose my stream of consciousness.

wombats say narf jello radical dude. goodnight.
