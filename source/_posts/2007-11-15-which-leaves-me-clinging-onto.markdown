Clinging onto the following:


#### The simplicity of the G-spel:


It's simple, isn't it?


> _But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, __even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)..._ - Ephesians 2:5-7


It's beautiful.


#### Shreds of indefatigable faith


I don't know where it all comes from, but a fraction of me knows You Love (me you them) even when I don't know who I am anymore (even when I want to give up on you, even when I want to drop this all and run).


#### The person of Jesus


Son of God. Political revolutionary. Light-bringer, hypocrisy-exposer. Rabbi, teacher, leader. Savior, superhero, tattered servant. Miracle worker, wounded healer. King, king, king.


#### Hope


**In heaven: **


> _...we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently._ - Romans 8:23b-25


That keeps me going. Dad, I just want to know you. When we meet, I anticipate being slack-jawed, wide-eyed, stunned, and speechless. My heart will race, my throat will be dry, I'll be deliriously happy and breathless.

**In the Church: **

(I use the term "Church" referring to "we ragtag band of Jesus-followers.")


> _For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. _- Ephesians 2:10


Maybe I'm a little too quick to give up on us. Maybe the church can be the voice of hope to the poor, broken, and brokenhearted in this world. Maybe the church will wake up from its slumber of materialism and learn to give selflessly. Maybe the church will stop thinking about its own needs and start wondering how it can meet the needs of others. Maybe by moving forward in action, we'll be changed and enthralled and delighted by the joy given to us by the Father.

Maybe the church will get an infusion of the Father's DNA. Maybe, just maybe.
