okay so my server's gone all funky... so any pictures will have to come later. but in the meantime i would like to draw your attention to the following links:
the CIA senior guy's appreciation night for the CIA senior sisters - wish i could've made it guys but you guys pulled yours off beautifully from what i heard. [check it out here.](http://www.angelfire.com/bc3/spectralxz18/)

[scott's xanga](http://www.xanga.com/item.asp?user=DaLoner&tab=weblogs&uid=13720572) after hsiang and i decided to give it a little lovin'

went with megan to get the corsage and boutonnierehoweveryouspellthat ordered in the morning, then swung by safeway to grab some dry pasta and noodles and sauce to cook up for the agape potluck. only when i got home i decided to work on my calc homework, and then when i realized that it was time to get the pasta started it was starting to look a little too late.

okay, so either i'm a really inefficient cook or i'm too optimistic about cooking times. in any case, it was some linguine noodles and pasta-something that i slapped together a lil TOO late and went over to dorothy's house where a bunch of people were already hanging out. super.

anyways we ended up eating some really great food and played a lot of fun and silly and probably just plain weird games..

wes demonstrates a kobe layup.. a good 10 feet away and 7 feet down from the basket..

in any case, it was a good time to bond with a lot of the younger guys in agape that i havent talked to in awhile.. you guys are awesome. looking forward to the next time.
