Oooooooh, [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com) got search capabilities! And AJAX-compatible back/forward buttons! And other goodies! I just nearly pooped in my pants when I saw the new changes go up.

Thank you thank you thank you, powers-that-be and code monkeys at Google. What a cool toy.

Nobody is paying me to say this. Good night.
