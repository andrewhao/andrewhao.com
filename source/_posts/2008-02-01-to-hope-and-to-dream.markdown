I want to hope! I must say this--it is impossible to follow Jesus without finding hope welling up in the heart. Hope for better things, hope of the ideal (this is the Kingdom, yes?), hope of Home.

This is what I want to say, but God, shake off this cynicism, this apathy and these religious cobwebs.
