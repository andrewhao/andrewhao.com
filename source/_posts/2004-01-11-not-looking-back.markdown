went to andrew hwang's 30th surprise party last night. wow, talk about old.. i think i'm joking  8O  andrew, besides having a wonderfully chosen name, has been the role model, the big brother, you name it since i can remember (4th grade? 5th?). i remember being in awe of his motorcycle.. in awe of his cycling prowess and definitely in awe of his berkeley degrees hahaha. in any case, we showed up, we ate good food, and jenga-meisters andrew yip and sarah battled it out. oh yeah, thanks for turning 30 andrew =)

i ended up skipping all-county honor band auditions because i couldnt make a rehearsal. MAN i'm regretting it already. it's my last year, wish i could've taken the opportunities to get that experience. terrible, really  :?

friday after our bible study small groups the guys and i did a push-up elimination round. sadly, i lost to these almightily buff frosh and soph who are young and chock-full of life and energy and all things young. meanwhile i kept hearing my bones pop like rice krispies.. yeah i felt like a dinosaur. probably weigh like one right now too.

new-whenever's resolution: i will identify people i want to be accountable with and i will be genuinely vulnerable with them.

_----edit - this broke my heart_
"because i always cut. like over summer... things got tough and those sissors or razor were my friends. i mean i stopped alot because of him. and my parents didnt know like any of this before school started and they saw it on my wrist near little vein's..."

"i wanted to cut last night. i didn't, tho. i listened to likin park. i love them. everything they say i can relate to."

"i looked at my scars today. they are all purple because it's cold. why did i make myself so ugly?"

**i was xangasurfing (again)** and came across the blogrings of teens that are into cutting (its a disorder where you literally take a blade and cut your veins). it was such a reality shock, and i just kind of stared at their pages that are full of hate and hopelessness at their own conditions.

**i dont know what **i would say to them. how could i? what could i possibly say? it's terrible, really  :sad:
i wish i could do more... oh man oh man oh man

"it really changed everything. going to the conference. i cried. i feel different. i took Jesus back nito my life all over again and i'm going to stop living this secret life that i have right there. this is my secret. and it will no longer be here. so i'm going deeper in my faith. i'm going to get a better relationship with God..."
