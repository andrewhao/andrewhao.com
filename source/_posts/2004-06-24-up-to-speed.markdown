went out running tonight. out back down cox, around seagull (taking quite a few hard breathers) and up onto the 85 overpass where i had to stop once again. man, it was beautiful. i don't even know how to describe it, but when the flourescent din of the bridge lights hits the sky (and gets lost in the process), somehow the fading sunlight looks even more lonely.

--

on a tangent, standing on that overpass (conveniently located straight over rush hour highway 85) made me feel like a kid again, feeling a little daring and a little uneasy wondering how long it would be before that thing would collapse (in my dreams they always would) with me right on it. here i am, twelve years later and still staring over the edge with trepidation and feeling my knees fill with weakness. i think i laughed out loud a couple minutes later on the way home, at the stupidity of such a fear, at the uneasiness that filled my bones and a little reassurance that hey -- maybe some things will never change and it's not so bad.

slightly nostalgic, gonna keep rambling. i got back home and tried to do pushups and situps but to no avail, i was quite the weaksauced weakling. i kept getting the image of mr. battaglia standing over me (soph year team PE) and drawling with that cocky smile of his "what's the matter, andrew? can't do a couple of pushups?" and then just to prove the imaginary him wrong i'd go for a couple more pushups before my muscles turned into a bag of jello. thank goodness it was dark or else the neighbor kids would be laughing at me.

never figured out why mr. battaglia seemed to like me yet hate me at the same time. i just know that my goal in that class was to prove him wrong and to show him that i WAS stronger and better than he thought i was. and man, i'll never know if i earned his respect or not, he just kept that gruff-faced demeanor on all the time and kept smiling some sort of secret smile, like he knew something we didn't. i thought i had it figured out once, but maybe i don't.

continuing the unintelligible gobbledygook, i watched mystic river last friday and it had a crazy plot about the relationship between three childhood friends who take different paths in life and one event that redefines all the relationships. makes me wonder how scriptwriters are able to come up with plots as crazy as those.

also watched 50 first dates last night -- cute, completely unrealistic, but cute. i say no more. thanks priscilla for always letting us mess up your house. :surprise:

if the cost of the movie ticket wasn't so darn sky high, then i'd actually go to theaters as opposed to waiting four months before the DVD comes out.

i've been doing some prayer and bible study with a group of guys and gals tuesdays at westgate (mall!) -- sharing and digging in with these guys really encourages me and pushes me forward with God. hey, one of these weeks, come with me.

**leaving on a jet plane** and i'll be back again july 2nd. leaving where? canada of course, home of trees, rocks (aka mountains) and if you look hard enough, a culture. okay, enough ragging on this majestic country, i'm sure it's gonna be a lot of fun. i'll be back later.

bbl. lame :)
