Man, today was good.  
  
Alex and I finished! After an epic final push in 125 Cory that was almost literally 24/7, after 220ish hours on this project, it ends with a A:LIFJDSGKSJD:FLKDF :D  
  
But even better, I got to talk with my small group leader and my pastor, Dave and Dennis this morning after service. It was so good; just a straight-shooting, edifying conversation about Jesus, the church, the Gospel, raw talk about real flaws. I tried to start with holy talk that made me look good (because who doesn't want to look good in front of their pastor?), but as they asked good, penetrating questions and shared their lives and flaws and Jesus working through their struggles, I had to let down my guard and listen. I also realized that I really want to become like these men. What does the Body of Christ look like? I've come a long way from last year's cynicism. Thank you Jesus.
