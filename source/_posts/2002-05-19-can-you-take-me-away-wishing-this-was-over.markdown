man.. chem has me so stressed out. big test tomorrow and i havent done my review sheet yet. haha.. nothing against answering questions or homework or anything.. but its a pain to logon to AIM just to get hit with 10 IM windows asking how to do this or whether i did that.

but you know what? i can't complain.. i'm (very) guilty of it too.. thats how we learn..cooperatively. it's the reason i'm doing (decently) well in flores.. i bug a lot of people (and probably **annoy them to no end**).

after church today a bunch of us went over to gabe and priscilla's house for their birthday party (apparently both their bdays are close). ate (a lot).. watched some movies.. talked.. yeah it was pretty coool

afterwards my family and i went to los altos first baptist church to watch my littlest sister's choir performance. actually it was more like a musical.. all i can say is "wow." it was really professionally done.. the kids all practiced a ton and it came out really nice. props to them.

school starts again tomorrow.. gah i can wait.
