okay.. short entry today. woke up a little later than normal (which meant i was barely in time for band). man... we did some hardcore stuff today. went through about seven or so more sets and put it all to music.

we've got some great freshmen, some soso freshmen and some awful freshmen. gotta work on em. hope they wanna work too. we're gonna be finishing the entire part 1 by tomorrow  8O impossible? i hope we can pull it off. 20-set doozy.

met up with victor li and picked up slurpees then headed to amber's for 04 backdrop painting.

let me state the obvious here: we're guys.
ergo: we can't paint.

well.. i tried at least. and i guess that the artistic girls fixed up my mistakes. most of them. hahaha.. well it was fun.

missions sharing night tonight at CIA. so we basically had urban plunge (inner city oakland) people share, the mexico (tijuana) people share, and then jerry lee share about his manila trip. very cool stuff.. being able to see how God's totally working stuff out all across the world. good stuff.

anyways i'm off to bed tonight. band tomorrow (when do i NOT have band?) and to tammy's for worship practice and then back to band for sleeeeepover! wheeee
