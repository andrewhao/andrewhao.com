wow.. what an amazingly busy day. if my schedule keeps up like this i'm on track to be dead in a few years or so. don't laugh yet. seriously.

**benjy** in math today: "andrew! you're still alive!"

**laura** @ track practice: "everytime i see you you're yawning.."

**me** (jerking awake): "wuh? waii.... where am i?"

yeah.. honestly my body's finding it tough to juggle the tasks of performing these tasks and staying conscious. yeeeup. doing homework at the last literal minute is never anything to sneeze at.

yeah.. i know i missed sadies this year.. combination of worship prac this week and a personal choice not to go. i guess i'd rather spend it at yg hahaha.. naw ya'll awesome. man this dance business is never easy stuff.. i mean the dance itself is all right, but everything else before and after can just create headaches for all parties involved. i guess that's why i've usually tried to shy away from them.. but yeah. to all the girls that got the courage to ask: you guys get major props in my book. hope everyone had fun!

i've never gotten so tired and sweaty playing the drums before tonight.. wow.. what a workout. kind of like lifting weights, only you're doing crazy reps with 8-oz sticks. but i digress.

i've been lagging so far behind in my QTs.. i've really gotta start spending some more time just chillin with God.. you guys might laugh but yeah i'm serious =D gotta clear up some time.. i can afford that.
