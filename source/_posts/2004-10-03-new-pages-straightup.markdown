IV Fall Conference was straight up sweet.
So.

my dad's always telling me how awesome college fellowships are cuz people in it are totally real and wanting to do things right. it was amazing talking to just about anybody and being able to go so deep and be so honest with each other.

couple things God spoke that went straight through my janky life and into my heart.

1) dude andrew, you're so much more messed up than you think you are. get off your pedestal and get right with Me.
2) for your perpetual struggles, i've got grace for you. i've got forgiveness. it's been paid in **FULL**???why can't you accept that i've already given it to you? stop beating yourself up each time, pick up that mat and walk!
3) **seek ME**???Jer29:11 means that i've got the perfect plan for you, but Jer29:12 says that you've gotta seek me first for it.

so between hanging with awesome boyz and girls, worshipping with abandon, being pranked on by seniors, breakdancing lessons, doing math homework in downtime and a marriage proposal???God used this weekend to bring me up to speed with Him and give me those straightupawesome times of refreshing. midterms are tomorrow and i've got no regrets  :)

bring it, whaaat.
