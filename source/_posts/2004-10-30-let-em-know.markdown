this week was incredible, one of those weeks where you look back and see God was totally working -- or maybe he's been working all along and I haven't noticed it till now. but there was just a continuous string of coincidences and Word that totally took me by surprise throughout the week through passages or phone calls (at seriously the right times) or chance random encounters and conversations with close people and random people or maybe just the laugh of a child that left me reeling with a "whoa, that was God."

i haven't had this feeling in awhile ??? call it sheer awe or euphoria? i don't know, but i feel like i need to tell everybody. it's crazy, i know, and this week was academically brutal and physically draining. but just to know that and realize that you were **carried** through this week???you couldn't have made it on your own???makes it that much more incredible.

---------------**onto the random:**
thursday was the first and last time i wear a kilt. there are absolutely no pictures in the public domain.

i'm slowly picking up slang from my friends. they include:
"i laaaahhhve it"
"oh dear"
"i'm feelin' it"
"that's how we roll"
"_DO_ IT" (starsky & hutch style)

saw liv and channing tonight. thanks for coming all the way up, totally miss home.

i balled with some random guys at the RSF on wednesday. this normally is not big news, but this time was like a battle. all i got to show for it were two fingers in the eye and a dislocated (temporarily) jaw. booya.

i made the pact to not cut my hair till thanksgiving. opinions run the gamut.
