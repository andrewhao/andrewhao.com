I recoil when I see Uggs. Literally, I flinch. Nothing against the ladies sporting them, but oh dear, nothing cries "gaudy" more than Uggs. Okay, maybe parachute pants. Or the mullet, but the awesomeness of said mullet overcomes the fashion disaster component.

I have no fashion cred whatsoever to be saying this. But I'm avoiding some work, so this is as good a time as any other.
