yea.. it's true i've started up just about zero homework.. but OH WELL. here's a few things to brighten your day:

from [joe tang](http://xanga.com/joemjtang)'s Xanga:

The Yao Ming theme song:

Yao Ming, Yao Ming-Yao Ming-Yao Ming, Yao Ming, Yao Ming

Yao Ming, Yao Ming-Yao Ming-Yao Ming, Yao Ming, Yao Ming

Yao Ming, Yao Ming-Yao Ming-Yao Ming, Yao Ming, Yao Ming

Yao Ming, Yao Ming-Yao Ming-Yao Ming, Yao Ming, Yao Ming

Without the Dream no one thought we'd survive,

For too long we've been deprived.

The final piece of the puzzle has arrived,

The missing link of a championship drive.

CHORUS

Yao Ming bust on the scene with a bling-bling,

Dominating other teams, it's a Ming Thing.

Envisioning Houston's dream of a ring-ring,

Reinvigorating Clutch City, Yao Ming - Scream!

"and the sad thing is...I actually sang it"



hahaha nice.. but i still dunno the tune  :(


annnd here's from Jon Chan's profile (he's EECS at UCSD):

Things I've learned in College:
- Drunk Drivers don't kill people, Engineering does
- Textbooks are useless...they're just written by some professor who needed something to help him/her outa their mid-life crisis
- Your "best" isn't good enough anymore...it's relative to the bell curve of the class
- Sitting in the front of the class makes lecture more personal? I think not.
- You can make length contract, you can slow down time...but never when you REALLY need it. (like before midterms.)
- It always rains during midterms and finals. (God is a funny guy!)
- Sleeping/living at the library with a blanket and a pillow is TOTALLY acceptable.



ah the life of a college student =X

i feel pretty bad for my mom.. she's taking courses at Western Seminary (she's training to become a counselor) and she's really been stressing out over various research projects and papers she's got to write up. yeah..i thought **i** had it bad.. she's staying up later than i am. i really look up to her.. juggling so many responsibilities. so yeah.. i should stop whining about my own problems.

well those were my distractions (and randomosities) of the day, peace-ing out.
