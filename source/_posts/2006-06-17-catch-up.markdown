Spent much of yesterday at work doing some somewhat-dry labor, building some profile info fields and writing a Rails DB migration script. I gotta say, echoing [Hsiufan](http://www.xanga.com/DarkWulf/496785395/sweet.html)'s observation, that Rails does take a lot of the situps out of the equation. Rails really does amaze me sometime, the MVC pattern is such a logical way of designing things and so many things are done for you. Unfortunately, that's the drawback; that so many things are abstracted away and hidden from sight that you can't figure out how to design them to your own liking. And Ruby, phew, it's just really cool. "I feel so much cooler using blocks!" says Hsiufan, and it's true. Who says that learning a functional programming language (i.e. SCHEME) was for naught! Hooray, high level programming languages.

Working for a web startup also comes with its own ups and downs. The ups are that it's just plain cool, getting [press](http://mashable.com/2006/06/14/faqqly-myspace-meets-yahoo-answers/#comments) and [buzz](http://reviews.cnet.com/4531-10921_7-6519243.html) and knowing you're making the 'net a cooler place but the downside is that.. it's kind of stressful knowing that there are a couple thousand folks who you need to keep happy with your updates. And that one night I [dreamt I killed the server](http://faqqly.com/faq/view_question/7/40558).

On the more personal side,

These days have been hot and muggy lately. I went out running at 9PM last night and the air was smooth and warm. That's definitely a good feeling. (I got my foot checked out the other week, and the doctor said it was just healing really slowly. So I can exercise now, but need to be pretty careful about doing so.)

And there are definitely a thousand side projects beckoning me to take on. Like fixing up the blog at  [www.g9labs.com](http://www.g9labs.com) and learning some extra blues licks on the guitar and finishing East of Eden and reformatting my desktop and whatever.

What's been tough is coming back home and relapsing into the person I was in high school, be it in relating to my friends or falling into old habits or in my attitude towards my parents. It's hard, to be honest.

But I want to make this summer count, you know? Spend some quality time with folks. Stop being the withdrawn he's-too-busy kind of friend. Live a life that overflows with love, live a life vulnerably exposed to my community. Grow in some spiritual disciplines of prayer and Word (learning to savor it because it is good). Stop living a life for myself (it's easy to do that in the summer). I'll let you know how it goes.

I like this one. Sara, Ryan, Dave, looking good in shades.
