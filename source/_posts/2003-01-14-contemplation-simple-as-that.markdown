i was originally gonna blab about finals and my day and the such.. but then i stumbled onto two xangas today, both through following random links around and reading their entries.. it felt like i could've done the talking.



> i'm one of the most self-seeking, egotistical people you'll ever meet...especially when it comes to singing. don't be fooled by my external portrayal of humility. i try to coerce myself into believing that i'm humble, but subconsciously, i'm developing this vicious ego. i juss know i am...

i feel like i've been concealing myself under this facade, like i'm hiding all the ugly aspects of my character because i don't want others to despise meeh. surprisingly, i'd actually love for everyone to see how wretched and weak of a person i am...that's the only way you can help meeh. and pride has been the critical dilemma that i've been struggling with the most...

> "???you???re not called to a regular life.???

I???m fighting at this point.  Inside there???s these emotions stirring me up and it???s like I???m telling myself for once I don???t want to live so spiritual??? if that doesn???t make sense, I was pretty much telling myself I want to for once live a life of some experience other than with God.  Even though this sounds, kind of harsh and selfish, it???s honestly pretty much what I was saying deep down. 



i've been letting my own wants and my own desires come in the way of what God's been trying to tell me. doing things my own way, shoving aside everything else. i've let academic scurrying around finals, social pressures and my _PRIDE _block out God.

you guys might ask.. man andrew.. how bad could it be? how bad can it get?

sometimes i feel like God's trying to use me.. trying to mold me and make the the best i could be but like pinnochio (man that's such a funky analogy) i just run away. i keep chasing after the meaningless.. the things that dont last.

and all that God says is.. _i just want you back._

so GOd.. im giving it all back to you again. my expectations and my grades. all my wants and wishes and dreams and fears - i wanna hand em all to you. how can i doubt and how can i argue? i'm sick of relying on myself and always failing. sick to the core. You're gonna hafta pull me through this.. i wanna live like YOU did.

true dat.
amen.
