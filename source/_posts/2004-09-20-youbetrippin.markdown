a hundred things to do and i'm juggling ninety nine. like a monster.

i was up till 4:30a last night, and all i have to show for it was a bombed midterm. i need to stop sleeping so wack, or study more frequently.

note to self: you are obnoxiously loud when your roommate's asleep. same thing as above.
