home for the weekend and i felt a year older already. funny what two weeks can do to you.

i've got it figured out: by the end of the semester i'll be 30.

oh man, now i'm not quite certain i'm going to survive all my classes. i've got this math53 lecture that consists of Prof. Kirby holding a mic to his mouth, muttering and scrawling notes on the blackboard all with his back turned to the 300-so of us.

me to the guy next to me: "is that a greek symbol?"
him: "no, that's a 'plus sign'"
me: (squinting and really embarrased)

is it just me or are all the math TAs the awkward, geeky types? they rock, i just wish they could explain things.. that we don't understand.. maybe once.

i used to think i was this awesome rapper cuz i could beatbox in the shower and listened to underground hip hop. then i thought i was this awesome emo-type rocker cuz i could wail out emo-ish lyrics to acoustic guitar and sound really sad. recently i took a listen to some polka music and i think i found my true identity: i'm swedish.
