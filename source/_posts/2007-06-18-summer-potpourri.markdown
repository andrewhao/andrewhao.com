Some random things I've been working on:  


  * I've been knocking off all the little emails, uploads, todo's and errands that have been sitting on the back burner for months. Let me tell you that it is a GOOD feeling watching them disappear off that to-do list.
  * [Wejoinin's got a blog](http://blog.wejoinin.com)! We'll keep you updated on how things are progressing. I've been doing iterative design with some UI mockups and working on some site templates. Hsiu-fan's working at Google this summer so he'll be up to his ears in work, but he'll find some time once in awhile to to chip in with some sweet code.
  * I built a [poor man's WiFi antenna](http://www.usbwifi.orcon.net.nz/) with a USB WiFi adapter and a strainer (please welcome the term, "wok-fi"). It's taking up a good chunk of my desk but it's working pretty well :D
  * I bought a [50mm fixed f/1.8 lens](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-Nikkor-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-2461799-0554231?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1182210679&sr=8-1) for the Nikon and shucks, it's amazing. I'm looking for an opportunity to shoot with this guy.
  * My jump shot. Ah, not much to say there :(
