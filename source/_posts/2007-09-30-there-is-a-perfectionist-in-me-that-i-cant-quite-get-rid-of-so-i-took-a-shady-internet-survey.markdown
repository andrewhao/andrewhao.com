There's a control-freak perfectionist in me that has a people-pleaser as a roommate (can you even be a people-pleasing control freak?)

I think this is the reason why I find it extraordinarily hard to say "no" to people. And it's why I find it hard not to go the extra mile.

I retook my [Meyers-Briggs](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm) profile a few weeks back and came out as a pretty convincing [ESFJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/ESFJ.html). Booyeah, it's pretty money.

So, how much do I just say "that's who I am" and how much do I submit to the Holy Spirit's transforming work in me? Perfection and people-pleasing and new life in Jesus, those are essays in themselves.
