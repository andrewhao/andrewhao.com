something's wrong but i'm not quite sure what it is. it sits in the bottom of my heart and weighs it down. it eats away at me like a cancer.

and the worst part is that i don't know if i can do anything about it.. except pray.

i know that next year i'll be browsing through my blog entries and laugh about how i was so moody. but i don't know if this is a mood.. there's something more to this.

**i'm not sure what it is **but it'd sure help to find out.
