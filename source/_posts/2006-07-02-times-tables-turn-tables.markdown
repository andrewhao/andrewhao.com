I am seven; seated across from my
father and scrambling to remember exactly what six times five is. I
have seven seconds to remember before my palm encounters the
curvature of a wooden spoon.  
  
They say you grow to become like
your parents. Whether you want to or not.  
  
_six one six  
six
two twelve  
six three eighteen  
six four twentyfour_  
  
This
is how I memorized my times table. Every night, my dad tests me on a
successive integer; I have fifteen seconds to tick off the ten
multiples to that number correctly, or I would invariably end up with
a sore palm and more than a few tears.  
  
Two years ago I sat
down with him over dinner and forgave him. Does that seem silly? So
many children go through serious abuse or grow up with a single
parent. And I'm going on about how my dad made me memorize my times
tables in second grade. There are so many more things to be hurt
over, there are so many more serious talks to have.  
  
But right
now, I'm seven. And this is something I cannot understand why I have
to go through. My father, at this stage, is an enigma to me. This is
a memory of him that I cannot reconcile with the man he is today (one
that I love and respect deeply).  
  
"You were my first
child. I made mistakes." He tells me this at eighteen, and again
I hold my breath and let the fear of tripping over a minefield of
numbers rush through me again.  
  
_six five thirty  
six six
thirtysix  
_  
I knew he wanted the best for me. He wanted me
to be ahead in school, to be one who could keep his head up and stay
ahead in class. Unsurprisingly, it worked.  
  
"You become
like your parents," they tell me, "whether you want to or
not."  
  
I don't know what that means. I have a vague
inkling of the wondeful truth behind that statement, and another
inkling of its weight. And my father, wholly human, would understand
making mistakes. It's a part of us.
