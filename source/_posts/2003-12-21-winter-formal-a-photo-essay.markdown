**Chapter Zero: The Night Before (aka My Stupid Body)**
**It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

The night before, Andrew had been studying for the bio test. that didn't bode too well with his body. "What are you doing to me?" Andrew's body asked. "I'm studying," Andrew dutifully replied. "Forget you," his body shot back. Fortunately for Andrew and unfortunately for the his body...

_figA:_ the source of strength, **coffee.**

_figB: _Okay, it wasn't coffee, it was **mountain dew.

**_figC: _Okay, fine, it was **mountain breeze**, _a la _Safeway Selecte (I added the e for refinement). Please imagine the product in the  figure above.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/finals2.jpg)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/finals1.jpg)Perhaps it was for lack of true caffeinated sources that Andrew's body decided to shut down on him. "Haha," it mocked him as he ran to school in bleary-eyed panic. In any case, the biology test wasn't too kind either. It got attitude on him.



Despite the **Mountain Breeze **fiasco, it was all right with Andrew. First semester was (virtually) over, winter break had started and formal was going to be a blast...

**Chapter One: Things The Manual Didn't Tell You About**
So Andrew figured he had formal all figured out. Simple, right? The guys have it easy, he reasoned. Shower, tux, hair, bada bing boom and you're done in fifteen minutes!

So it was a few errands in the afternoon, a corsage pickup at Bob Gilmore's and Andrew once again found himself sitting at home with one and a half hours to kill. Dinner reservations were at 5:30PM (yes, they were quite early) at the illustrious **Bucca Di Beppo's **(more on that later). He was faced with the all-encompassing question:

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/watchfrys.jpg)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/watchclock.jpg)  
to **a) **check out cool stuff at frys? or to** b) **dutifully get dressed on time?

Andrew was still contemplating the pros and cons and ins and outs of each choice when he received a phone call from Catherine. "Hello?" he asked. "Is it okay if I come over now?" says Cat on the other end of the phone. "Oh crud!" the Voice In Andrew's Mind goes. He remembered he was going to drive Joe and Cat (he knew them from CIA youth group) to formal too.

One look at the clock: **5:00PM**. Could he get ready in fifteen minutes as advertised?
Let's imagine the next sequence in quick succession:
![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/rush.gif)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/shampoo.jpg)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/late.gif)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/gel.jpg)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/rush.gif)

The shower and hair part was done in record time, but what now? The tux wasn't cooperating too well at this point. "Knock knock" went the door. "Aw crud," went the Voice in Andrew's Mind.

![](http://www.garystuxshops.com/images/prom_C.jpg)
Andrew wasn't feeling quite like this.

But given some time and some creative jury-rigging, the Light Side had triumphed.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/catjoedrewtree.jpg)
They were ready to go.

**Chapter Two: Okay, Now What Did You Forget?**

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/athome.jpg)
And so they pulled out of the driveway...

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/onroad.jpg)
...on the way to pick up Soo.

"Wait," said Andrew.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/directions.jpg)
"I forgot the directions." Strike one.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/athome.jpg)
"Now you sure you have everything?" cat asked.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/onroad.jpg)
"Positive," Andrew replied.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/tickets.gif)
"Wait. The bids."

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/athome.jpg)
The passengers grumbled, Andrew hung his head in intense shame.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/onroad.jpg)
"You're sure you have everything?" Joe asked again. "Absolutely," Andrew replied.

Andrew called Soo. "We're coming over.. but uh.. think Asian time."

The three of them did manage to get to Soo's house.. in a very Asian time frame. Fortunately Soo didn't bust anything over Andrew's head for being so absentmindedly late. Now if he wasn't wearing a tux, things might have been different.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/onroad.jpg)
The four of them got back into the car. "Wait," the Voice in Andrew's Mind went.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/corsage.jpg)
"Where are the flowers?"

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/athome.jpg)
"Next time you should make a checklist" suggested Joe. "But then you'd forget the checklist."

"Thanks," Andrew replied.

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/onroad.jpg)
Andrew called Andrew Yip. "We'll be there.. but think Asian time."

According to the Law of Asian Time For Formals, you are allowed to be late for about 45 minutes, give or take a couple. The group decided to take advantage of that and show up that many minutes late. But the important thing is that they showed up.

"Do you have to go home to get anything?" asked Joe as he got out of the car.

"Shuddup."

**Chapter Three: Dinner or Bathrooms to Die For**


![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/nicewall.jpg) Not that Andrew would actually die for the bathrooms, but the reason why he was looking so forward to eating at **Bucca Di Beppo's** was for its totally awesome restrooms. Yes, folks, the restrooms are an experience by themselves. Specifics will not be revealed here. In any case, Bucca Di Beppo's is a very.. eclectic restaurant with family sized meals (read: huge) and interesting.. (see pic to the left) wall ornaments made for quite the dining. The food, in Andrew's very humble opinion, was well worth the price. And with three boxes of leftovers to be eaten later, it was safe to asume that most people had their fill. The dates made their obligatory synchronized disappearance as per Rules of Formal Dinner. "Have fun," the guys told the girls. The boys were sure they did as they were left staring at the decorative wall. 











Eating with studs like these boys reassured Andrew that he was in the company of men:
![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/dinguys1.jpg)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/dinguys2.jpg)
**a)** andrew yip, alex choy, hao & **b)** tianqi (monster!) and derrick

The ladies of course were looking very graceful in their formalwear..
![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/dingirls2.jpg)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/dingirls1.jpg)
**a)** cat, yvonne, andrea & **b)** soo and megan.

Aftewards, there was the obligatory photo shoot. The ladies went first:

Then the men:

**Chapter Four: I'm Not Lost, This Is the Scenic Route**
In the interest of saving space, words shall be conserved in this chapter.

"Sorry about that," Andrew apologized. "It's formal; it's tradition to get lost. Not that I am."

**Chapter Five: Gangsters on the Dance Floor**


![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/csuen.jpg)There were clear signs of thug activity on the dance floor, let's take for example Chris Suen sportin' a tux that could kill if you looked at it long enough. In any case, Andrew thought the Villa Ragusa was very nice place to be.. cool stairwell, nice and big ballroom and of course, the full-service bar (serving coke, sprite and other fine refreshments) and heck, who can argue with chocolate dipped strawberries, chocolate dipped something else and well.. more chocolate? If that doesn't mean "gangster", then nothing else is. Other guys and gals that made the night a little more dangerous:




![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/andrewvic.jpg)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/euggar.jpg)
**a)** andrew and a thuggish vic & **b)** the ASB boys want to fight?!?!!

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/andrewkelley.jpg)
andrew and kelley are reppin'

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/charles.jpg)
this guy.. that hat.. too cool :)

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/jeanhao.jpg)![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/jeanhsiang.jpg)
**a)** jean and andrew take on the asb boys & **b)** jean and hsiang, triad members

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/discchocolate.jpg)
Fortunately for Andrew, he discovered the chocolate in time...

![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/powerranger.jpg)
..to become a mighty morphin power ranger.
minus the mighty part.
and maybe the power part too.

**Andrew couldn't stop feeling the beat.**
"EEEEEElectron Transport Chain.." he sang.
People gave him funny looks.
"...powers ATP Phosphoryla-SHUN!!!"
They turned to death glares. Death threats even.
Soo just shook her head. Perhaps 50 Cent
and bio were never meant to mix.

Ah, biology on the dance floor.

**Noteworthy Notes:**
Andrew Menalienko was looking quite gangster in the blue suit.
Benjy Liang was looking regal, blinding even in the pure white. Andrew thought the words "Gandalf the <strike>Grey</strike>White" came to mind. Too crazy those two :D

**Chapter Six: I'm Not Sleepy Are You Sleepy?**
Four hundred people filed out of Villa Ragusa, about twenty of them decided to head over to Andrew Yip's house. Andrew Hao thought that was nice of him, and probably even nicer of his parents.

Throw this in:
![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/ps2.jpg)

Then throw this in:
![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/wformal/pirates.jpg)

It was fun, but perhaps it was the biology that had thrashed and fried and shredded his mind the night before that Andrew knew he had to get home.

**3AM it was**. "Ah, a real bed," said Andrew's body. "Ah, real sleep," said Andrew.
He slept in the tux.
