let's get one thing straight: in terms of academics and the such, i got zero of it done today. zero.

and i'm not very cool with that. something about this break that makes me feel like i didnt achieve my main goals, which were, generally to:

1. relax
2. get the hw done.

in no particular order. it's strange.. i've kept myself so busy, preventing myself from relaxing (but none of the things i'm doing is related to hw, save a spanish video project)

tomorrow i will achieve both. i will sleep late in the morning, then utilize my afternoon for homework (APChem, anybody?  :? ) then a family dinner at night then to paul yan's for the guys sleepover. i will stick to my schedule. I CAN DO THIS.

i've been trying to shirk responsibilities for this long over break.. time to meet em head on.

on a separate note, the spanish video is now complete! screen stills to be posted at a later date.

on a TOTALLY different note, my dad's (is there an apostrophe there? that's weird) continual quest for perfect kimchi (in chinese, called _pao tsai_) is soaring to new levels. we've got two containers filled with it and the uh.. aroma is starting to fill the refrigerator. which is not a good thing.
