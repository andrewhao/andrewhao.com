i sit here in front of the computer at my aunt's house while mad thoughts of symbolism and quotes and metaphorical objects run amok in my mind. an empty Word document sits in front of me, all my work untransferred from my mind into my brain. and i'm finding it harder and harder to think of anything.

my two little cousins sit to my left on the floor. the older one is reading harry potter. she is 170 pages in, which is quite impressive for a 3rd grader. the younger one is sitting cross-legged, eating trix cereal out of a plastic bag.

my ponderings on the 7-year separation of Reverend Dimmesdale and Hester Prynne are rudely interrupted by a querying voice. "Andrew, did you know that Harry Potter has an owl?"

"hold on, i'm busy right now," is all i can mumble. my elbows fight to cradle a book that could shut in my lap at any instant.

her little voice continues. "Did you know that he gets a cookie for Harry every time before he goes to sleep an' after he goes back to owl school."

i fight to hold my train of thought. my brain can't quite seem to remember since when Harry's owl ever got cookies for Harry, or if his owl ever went to owl school but that's probably because Hester and the Reverend are vying for my attention right now.

"mm yeah i remember," i mumble again.

my second cousin seems to be entranced by the computer screen. on the desktop is a big bright picture of a purple flower. she stares openmouthed at the bright image. the only thing moving on the desktop is the scrolling AIM stock ticker. i resume my work, but then glance over at her seconds later. she is still transfixed in awe.

"Is that a pilgrim?" she asks. I realize she's looking at one of the websites I've got opened up. well actually it's a Puritan. but no biggie. "We have a pilgrim party at school next week!"

"Andrew, what does 'transfer' mean?" The older one points a finger at the book. i twist my neck to look over.

jazzy guitar riffs lazily drift from the computer speakers. Harry Potter's now meeting with Hagrid on the mountain. man.. it's been awhile since i've read this.

"Andrew, what's a gameskeeper? What kind of games do they keep?" asks the older one. the younger one motions for me to look at her. she's got a banana trix balanced on her tongue. she laughs.

and suddenly i realize the essay can wait.
