6/16/02

woke up 9:30AM and realized that breakfast was ending in 30ish minutes.. so i stumbled into the elevator groggy eyed, bedheaded (to an extreme =D) and everything.

our hotel was located pretty close to niagara falls itself. all throughout the night i could hear this faint rumbling sound and you know.. its pretty cool to be witnessing niagara for yourself. we walked into niagara falls state park where we watched the falls from the top really briefly.. but my dad decided that we'd go take the boat tour. and wow.. i guess i wasnt really prepared for it. the falls throw up a whole lot more mist that you'd expect. even though they gave us ponchos and everything, everybody pretty much got soaked nonetheless. but hey.. i mean you read all these stories and see the documentaries but nothing really prepares you for niagara until you actually get there. seeing nothing but water on three sides around you and all that sound it generates is a pretty cool experience.

maybe it'd be more moving if i wasnt trying to stay dry. haha.. it proved to be a futile effort. we headed over to the canada side of the falls where we spent a good 30 minutes driving in circles trying to find our hotel. our room had a real nice view of the falls and everything.. you can really see the entire falls and all the mist it generates. totally awesome.. made even better by the three hour nap i took in the afternoon =D

went over to the outback restaurant (gosh they're everywhere) across the street from the hotel. got some amazingly huge chicken/rib combo.. oww im too full right now =P picked up some cool australian lingo haha.. "bloke" "bonzer" "tucker". too bad i dont have the crocodile dundee accent.

they illuminated niagara falls with lights behind the falls that change colors every 5 minutes or so.. really nice at night. every friday and sunday here they hold fireworks displays and so we got back in time to see that. totally nice way to end today. tomorrow we head over to boston to.. do whatever. my dad wants me to go see harvard.. or does HE wanna see it? hahaha 8 hour drive.. oh man i'll have lots of time on my hands.
