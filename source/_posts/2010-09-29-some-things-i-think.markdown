I feel pretty comfortable walking around shirtless. Sunday at 3pm before service I walked into the chapel sans shirt to find Albert there doing couples' counseling. Guy: hey, he's shirtless. Albert: yeah (silence)... he's an intern. I blame this all on Dave, who is shirtless over half of the time.

My diet consists two parts peanut butter jelly sandwich, one part spaghetti and one part whatever the heck we find lying around. It's just carbs and sugar... I don't think I've eaten vegetables in a week. Except after service when we had the party platter of hummus.

I get pretty mad when people leave litter in the parking lot. This isn't just like a wrapper here and there, but it's like entire boxes of empty Capri Suns. There is definitely a culture of littering here.

Stephen Ministry is the best thing ever. I mean yeah this whole "feelings" bit is terrifying, but on the bright side, one of our classmates is an eighty year old grandma who makes excellent brownies. And she can see into our souls. Nice.

I have an IT band injury so I can't go running for who knows how long and it's pretty frustrating.

Sometimes I visit cities other than Oakland and remember what clean looks like.

Doesn't matter what just dropped. Long ago I lost any qualms about picking it up with bare hands.

I really enjoy being in this community. I am reminded that life is short, Jesus is Good, laughter is contagious, and shirts are always optional.
