6) hang arond at the DYC for the Oasis services held afterwards. Wicked Saved led worship. talked to jaeson ma for a couple of minutes, he is being majorly used by God and jetsetting all over the place.. incredible stuff happening down in South Africa. also met a bunch of World Mission people. and finally got to sit with black people in a service.. NICE  :D
7) back home, worked on some agape flyers tomo
8) kinko's at 1:30AM.
9) at home, writing up a pointless entry.

okay i'm done. five minutes were robbed from your life, thirty minutes from mine. all fair? i'm not sure why i still write these, if only to justify to myself this break wasn't completely wasted =) so there.
