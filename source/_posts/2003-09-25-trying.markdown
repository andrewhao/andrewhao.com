i miss dancing when i felt like it. i miss staring out onto the beach in mexico and feeling so close and intimate and _right there_ again. i miss the laughter and joy and rush of happy jumbled inexplicable emotions in worship. i miss waking up in the sleepy knowledge that i'm safe and secure in Somebody's arms. in knowing that i don't have to fight anymore, to fear anymore, to chase after empty dreams anymore. most of all, i miss the innocence.. not naivete but true, real innocence.

yet i'm still fighting, still fearing and still chasing. something went wrong down the way, and i'm trying to find my way home.
