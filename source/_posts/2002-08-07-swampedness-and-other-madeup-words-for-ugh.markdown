sorry for the lack of attention to the blog and profile.. i've been sort of busy lately coding script for the junior class website. maybe TOO busy. heck, is it healthy to spend 8 hours straight on the computer? not like that's abnormal.

but i gotta say.. its gonna be awesome stuff.. i hope its something that keeps people coming back. cuz that'd make it even greater. anyways, check out my progress at the beta page HERE:
http://gsgnine.arabiafish.com/beta/

today class was all review of the entire quarter.. eh sort of boring. i havent been paying any real attention this last week cuz.. well.. why would i want to? the good news is i think i can scrape by with an A (due to the weighted grading system). i just need to do decent on the final and i'll be fine. but again.. i need a crazy amount of self discipline for next year if i wanna get things done.

you see here's how it works. i wanna do a bunch of activities (sports, MB, active participation in youth group) but i won't be able to handle those and my academic workload until i learn to manage my time better. that means **no slacking!** no daydreaming. no wasting time. get home and BAM its all work.

sigh.. but i've never done that before.. what makes you think you can do it in three weeks andrew?

anyways im gonna go out to run with victor. i'll post when the issues weigh heavy again =P
