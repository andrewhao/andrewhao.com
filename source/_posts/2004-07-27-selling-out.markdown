retreat was most excellent. what made it so powerful for me was finally experiencing everything in total abandonment. it's taken me years to get to this point (er am i really there yet?) always struggling with myself to give up my ideas and desires for comfort, security, companionship and even my future. funny how recently God's been throwing massive wake-up-calls, billboards if you will, my way. saying "okay Andrew, surrender this to me. good? okay, now can you surrender that?" and i'd hesitate and waffle and be so unsure. and i think it was particularly after the fast a couple of weeks ago that i felt a sort of freedom from myself. like i was willing to give it all (well, at least a big chunk).

do you want to have passion and experience Me to the fullest? then sell out all of yourself to Me. that's right, your addictions, your desires, your deepest darkest secrets. give em up and I'll honor that.

that's what's been requested of me. and i'm not anywhere close to that, but i felt that the reason why this retreat was more powerful for me was because i'm getting closer (or at least i'm trying).
