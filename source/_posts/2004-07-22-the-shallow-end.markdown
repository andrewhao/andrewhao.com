today was the one day where i felt accomplished this summer. half the fence is done, and the site's mostly finished. went up to fremont older hills with eliot and biked for a bit. caught up with jason wang who was in the area and we caught up at a starbucks. hahaha dude look how we turned out. what a stud, whatta Godly stud.

sorry, nothing too deep in this post. summer retreat's tomorrow and i'm pretty pumped. buck buck is going down, bring on the male bonding baby.

oh yeah: **to do before heading off to higher education:** get a scottish accent, and do it well.
