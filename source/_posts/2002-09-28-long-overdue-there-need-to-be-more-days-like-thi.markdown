got a lotta time today.. so i'll take a little more time to journal. kinda busy today. we had marching band practice in the morning and i was planning to kind of back off a bit on the intensity.. but i worked my butt off anyways (anything for mb.. i'm such a band geek now haha). yeah.. i got frustrated at my section over a few sets and their general marching technique but i guess i can't blame them. some people are just getting lazy and not caring. that's the main problem. some of our guys just arent caring - and if you don't care there's no doubt that your posture or your marching technique are gonna suffer.

but yeah.. i really hate to act like a prick (to say the least). but i guess that's just how mb is.. really.. military-like. channing and i have really been working hard this year to not only keep everybody in check but to gain some respect and unity among ourselves. sometimes it seems so hopeless - THE UNDERCLASSMEN DONT GET IT. but then i can't blame em.. they don't know how it feels to win. they don't know that elation you feel and that sense of accomplishment when you storm the field at the massive awards ceremony at the end of a competition. heck, i don't even know what it's like. but this year is gonna be all different.

er yeah.. that ended my mb tangent. on the topic of journaling - i was looking back at a few old journals and i realized that my tone has really changed since my first few posts. yeah.

varsity xc went to the stanford meet today. wow.. it was just huge. i'm gonna hazard a guess that a bit over a thousand people ended up competing (there were 280 in my race ALONE.. think about all the other girls and jv and divisions that were running). 3.1 miles but the weather was NICE. yeah.. it was really demoralizing at the start because i start out slow and work up. man.. i was seeing a sea of people 400m ahead of me within like.. fifteen seconds. haha at one point i was boxed in between the trail fence and the outer shell of runners and there were these tree branches coming up over the trail. i couldnt do anything so - SMACK - i ran right through them. but yeah i was feeling pretty good today. the hill i didnt feel too bad and i didnt start feeling it until the last 400m when i got roadkilled (xc term) by five or so sprinting guys. such is the life of an xc runner.

it's cool cuz i beat 100 people.

it's not so cool because 180 people beat me.

but still.. i ran a reported 18:18 time. they say to subtract 45 seconds from your stanford time to approximate your crystal springs time. and so theoretically i should be running about a 17:30 crystal time. last year at CCS i ran 18:30. yow. i'm really surprised. this season should be really great.

we got back to lynbrook about 3ish and hey.. the varsity football game was still going on (the one where the marching band was playing at). haha it was really funny because mb people were the most spirited people out there. if it werent for us.. who would console the varsity players after their (expected) losses..

not to rag on varsity or anything. we've actually got some pretty decent guys (the bencomos and victor shyu).. its just that a lot of people didnt join football this year because of.. who knows what.

jack came over to lynbrook and conveniently caught me. we went over to muir to play some bball. agh. i've lost it all. thank you very much.

family went to sweet tomatoes today. i forgot how great the food there was (mostly because i was starving like crazy!). nice.

anyways..that caps up a very nice saturday. there need to be more like this.
