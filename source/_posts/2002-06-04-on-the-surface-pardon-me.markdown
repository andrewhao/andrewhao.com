okay.. im gonna apologize for not really doing much with this in the past week.. finals are next week and i guess that's when teacher's love to kill you with stuff..

strange, cuz i was under the impression that the week before finals week meant **LESS** work, no?

in any case, i'm being smothered in all this crud that i "forgot" to do (and/or the teachers are just being stupid about it) x.x hehe.. i dont know if i can say much.. its mostly my fault yeah yeah yeah

i spent 6 hours on chem today. impressive? maybe just plain SAD. bahhhhh..

yearbooks come out in two days.. very exciting.

school's out in two weeks.. thats very exciting too.. kinda scary too.. and a bit sad too. yeah.. i guess i hope to hang out with some of you guys this summer.. call me up and we'll see what we can do eh? =P

okay, its back to the chem-a-thon. see yuh..
