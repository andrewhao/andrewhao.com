day three of track and i'm feeling pretty glad.

i'm glad i still have feeling in my lower body.
i'm glad i havent broken any bones.
i'm glad i havent gone to the hospital yet.
i'm glad my muscles are "responding" to my workouts. that is, they're on fire. feel the burn, baby.

ouch. in any case, today i learned the secret of life that all high schoolers should figure out before they graduate: **if you want to ace a test, you should study.**

that is, i didnt study and i sure didnt ace that calc test. bleagh.. that was all me to blame. i left it all out to the last minute, figuring i'd study at school.. and so i left my calc book at home. smart, boy.

the car did something really weird to me yesterday.. i was about to turn right at the johnson-prospect intersection when all of a sudden i felt the car roll backwards. the accelerator pedal didnt seem to be doing anything and so i slammed the brakes and shut off the engine. surprise - the engine wouldn't crank, the transmission was stuck and my brakes were jammed. and a lot of angry people were stuck behind me.

so i just waited for about 5 minutes in sheer panic, wondering what was wrong when i started the car again and it was normal again. hrm. who wouldathunkit? eh.. we're probably gonna drop the car by to get checked out sometime. wow.. a mere 4500 miles and it's acting up. how sad.

agape yesterday was interesting to say the least =D after bible study, the bell rang and i was ambushed. let's just say that after a lot of plastic packing tape, an entire roll of saran wrap and (nearly) getting carried horizontally to spanish class (late, too), i could sure feel the love  :) thanks guys.. i'm not gonna forget that. but i'll sure wish i did.. hahaha good thing the quad was semi empty.

all right.. i'm gonna go shower now then come back and do some essay typing. whee, that's sure to be fun.
