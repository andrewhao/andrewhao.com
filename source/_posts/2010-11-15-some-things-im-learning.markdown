I really admire [Eric](http://my.opera.com/nosabe332/blog/)'s patience with people. After Evangelism class he spent an hour and a half with a wheelchair-bound Betty Dunn, doing genealogy searches with her and looking at photos on Flickr. I normally don't have any patience with people like Betty, because I want to send her home as soon as possible so I can get the things done in my schedule that I need to do.

"I just tell myself that I've got nothing better to do with my time [than spend it with Betty]" Eric says.

That's kind of like what it's like in genuine relationships, huh? That nothing is more important to you than spending time with them right there. I got really convicted of that. My personal tendency is to overschedule things and then shove people into these boxes. But real love knows that people take time. People have dreams, random thoughts, fears, and desires. I'm learning about real love.

Another thing I'm learning came through a [Tim Keller sermon](http://sermons2.redeemer.com/sermons/praying-spirit) [Justin](http://themarrow.wordpress.com) sent me about prayer:


For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father." (Romans 8:15)


TK was saying how "Abba" is less "Daddy" than "Da-da", that it's a cry that we all know from birth, a primal, instinctual cry for our Father's help and support. And another thing TK points out is that we _cry;_ we don't state, or request, or merely say. It's weirdly comforting knowing that life is supposed to come with pain, that even the strongest and wisest go through depression, that there's no happy-clappy remedies except to endure and to hope and persevere when all we know how to say is _Dad... help_. Following Jesus isn't supposed to be easy, but our Dad is really a Good dad.
