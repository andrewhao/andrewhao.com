Mmmyeah! Back home after 2 months out.
Oh my goodness, I've really missed my family (I just don't have time to realize it when I'm at school). Ever get the warm fuzzies? There was a little of that back home last night.. like this is where home is. I've missed this without realizing it.

And freakin.. I have been blessed with so much. Like ridiculously much. Like I-Don't-Deserve much, and in truth, I really don't. I've written a lot about how I struggle with this.. freakin why do I have it so good? And I come to realize.. this is one of the "good and perfect gifts" that get given to us, and the question now becomes how do we respond to these gifts and how can we bless others with them? Um, I actually don't know, but I think acknowledging the fact we don't deserve them and in turn acknowledging who they came from is a good start.

And each of YOU, homefrie(nd)s, I am debted to. You know that one of my chief regrets about high school was that I never really got to know you guys at a deeper level. That was probably 99% my fault, cuz I bought into the "the-busier-you-are-the-better-you'll-be" psychosis. Hence we never got the chance, cuz I never had time. And look where it takes us. Mm, I've gotta let you know that each one of you has infused a little chunk of your personalities, your eccentricities and your wisdom into my life. Look where it takes me.

Mm, this is going to be one long stream-of-crap post.

I'm honestly a little afraid to meet up with you guys. No, that's not the word, but a little intimidated. Mm, partly because I really admire who many of you have become and the ways you're all choosing your own paths. But probably more in the ways you'll examine me and maybe I'll be exposed for the ways in which I haven't changed???I'm still the somewhat frazzled can't-talk-gotta-go kind of semifriend I was to you a few years ago. How embarrassing.

There's so much I have to share though. And I'm also afraid of talking about it, because so much of it is in the way I'm learning to grow and love this Jesus fellow. And, like, I'm super hesitant to share cuz some part of me is still ashamed and afraid that you won't believe the ways he's doing cool stuff.

Okay, I thought I was addressing one specific audience, but I'm not sure who I'm addressing anymore.

I'd talk some more, but I think I've forgotten.

Anyways, I'm stuck at home this week/end. Working. I think that's somehow contrary to the spirit of Thanksgiving. Ahwell, I am. The short and long of it is: I'd love to see yall folks again, that would make my day.

Peace, do good.

**Funny Thing, This Teen Angst Is**
I was reading some of my old Xanga entries, and found this

a lifeline is all she needs
but she's still trapped beneath the surface
beneath the weight of the world
an opportunity is all she needs
but she watches them stolen
one by precious one
a respite is all she needs
but it resides in her system
eating her from the inside out
a goal is all she needs
but they become meaningless
and blow away - chaff in the wind.

a smile is all she needs
