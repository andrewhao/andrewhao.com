I'm terrible at maintaining relationships. Sure, I know tons of people, but I can't very well say that I play an active role in maintaining them. It should worry me a lot more than it does now.  
  
For example, I never call my parents... it just never crosses my mind.  
  
In high school, I rarely talked to my sisters (this was partially because I was always off doing something or the other. But that's no excuse). It's not that I don't love them. They just don't often cross my mind (and revealing this in this public space is kind of scary for me).  
  
I'm very good at withdrawing and keeping to myself. I'm very good at neglecting relationships with people if they don't make an effort to maintain the relationship.  
  
I don't know if it's a side effect of the constant doing-ness that I've been immersed in from junior high on, but it worries me. That I can duck into my own world for days at a time and completely ignore the network of friends, family and community.  
  
It's why I'm sometimes apathetic towards relationships (the romantic ones). I worry that, well, I just won't care enough to maintain the relationship (does that sound arrogant?).  
  
Sometimes, I just don't care enough. Can I admit that? I know, it makes me sound like a monster. And I'm not very sure how much to attribute to my personality and how much to simple selfishness.  
  
I knowï¿½on some head-knowledgey levelï¿½that a paucity of expressive love is due to never having experienced its fullness before. I'm still trying to understand Abba's love. I'm still building my vocabulary, still learning its language.   
  
And it's not just in that abstract level either. I'm learning from everyday expressions of friendship, from homeboys who still keep in touch through email. I'm learning from observing a community pouring out on each other. I'm trying to savor the moments when I stop and realize that this exact moment was a gift, a freakin' amazing gift.  
  
And I'm in this process of having that ol' heart of stone transformed into that fleshy one. Jesus, show me how to love (in the myriad of infinite ways) as You do.
