im getting into this groove of lateness.

**case in point #1:**
today, i woke up at 9:03. **problem?**
xc practice started at 9:00.

**case in point #2:**
agape core meeting at 2:30. **problem?**
i get there at.. oh.. 3:40.

tony xu (aka **THE MAN**) gave me pointers the day before.. in order to really be successful.. you need to schedule out every part of your day. that means no procrastination. no wasting time. nada.

and i figured.. hey.. im gonna start my own rehab program. gonna whip my self-discipline into shape so i can handle junior year well (enough). this way i can handle all my killer activities and sports and extracurrics and still survive!

and one day later its dawning on me: **this could be a bit tough.**
anyways.. i need to do this.. i have to. and that means sacrifice: this blog will be DEAD from september -> june. unless something major comes up.

anyways at that agape meeting today daniel was telling us about his china trip and how awesome and how real God was over there.. major spiritual warfare too. and you know.. to experience a God that real and that powerful is something that i really long for. and i think that part of the reason that isnt happening in my own life is cuz im not willing to give up some parts of my own life... i dunno.. i just cant seem to give it up. you know that roadblock i was talking about a while ago? this is it. and it's what i'm fighting against.
