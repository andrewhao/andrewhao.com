today was brutal. woke up at 7AM and asked myself: what in the world am i supposed to be doing right now? left the question unanswered, turned around and then slept 2 more righteous hours.

today was brutal. mid 80 degree heat, six-plus miles in the fremont older hills. felt good, in the way that uninvited pain can only be. that is, not very.

today was brutal, driving with brian park in the passenger seat and his accented ebonics "an i be lahk did you jus snap at me gurfriend? ah KNOW you did naw jus snap at me..."

today was brutal, ten hours and no shower. but you didn't need to know that. body odor may be the best insect repellent known to man.

okay i'm going to stop trying to be funny.
