i think today was just a great day to sorta just relax and avoid responsibility =D it was cool being able to see all the college ppl coming back (and angela all the way from virginia) at church. speaker was josh lee from summer retreat and i think his message was really applicable to me. man.. worship team was really big today. jeremy's first time with us doing guitar.. joe on electric, david on violin along with .. everybody else =D

one thing i've realized this week is the extent to which my relationship with God has deteriorated.. i've felt so.. empty recently.. like i've lost my purpose in life. like i was wandering the lynbrook halls without knowing what i was doing and where i was going. but i really wanna change that over break, especially with all this newfound free time. i just wanna reconnect.. and somehow get in touch with God again.

after church we all went over to bill of fare restaurant (aka "the restaurant") and ate some good greasy-fattening food. went over to ed's to meet up with vinny jack john and gary for some bball at country lane, where the hoops are all about.. oh.. two feet high =D

oh man i felt like vince carter or something.. nothing like a good dunk to boost your self confidence a lil hahaha =D eventually we saw these 8th grade guys and decided to play em. we won but whew.. those lil kids have skills (not to mention dirty mouths lol) haha fun...

was sitting in the restaurant listening to the christmas music and got nostalogic all of a sudden.. christmas used to mean so much to me back in the day.. what happened? why am i not in the christmas mood? christmas used to mean the class parties back in elementary school homeroom. christmas used to mean presents under the tree that you could already guess. it meant ooing and aaahing while listening to christmas music in a dark room watching the lights on the christmas tree blink. so what happened?

aye.. sorry if i'm sounding like the grinch here. once you've lost the magic, it's hard to get it back...

but i must end this entry on a happy note. hope you guys are all enjoying your break.. thanks everybody for the presents and the "merry christmas"es.. you're all awesome and i gotta get to sleep now cuz i'm dead tired.
