Whoa, okay, here it is again, stronger than I remember it being.

**EVERYTHING SOUNDS LIKE RELIGION**. Or, at least it makes a very close rhyme.

Why did following Christ have to get tangled and mixed up with all this junk? With a political party, with hypocritical media images, with cheesy televangelists, with Western powermongers? Why does following Christ make me conscious of appearing like a finger-pointer, lie-speaker, law-enforcer, Bible-thumper?

And what the heck do I do? Do I react against these stereotypes and try to act & dress hip, listen to cool music, try to prove to (who?)somebody that Jesus is, on the contrary, a rockstar enviro-conscious Democrat who loves you, and respects your religions but dood you don't have to accept him, it's all good.

Religion: I feel this way the most at fellowship and church. I bite my tongue when I see one of my brothers talk down to another (but hides it in highfalutin' spiritual language). I get this way when Christians get in a tiff arguing over minor doctrinal issues. I get it when pride rears its ugly head. Man, I'm more bitter than I thought. Help me God.

Am I naive to believe that intimacy with God is the source of Life? That inspires a personal response of holiness, gratitude and worship? That pushes us onward and outward to pursue social justice and mercy causes, that starves hypocrisy and births love love love?

And I know that all this bitterness is already taking me down the wrong road???I'm making this big blanket statement: _Don't tell me what to do!_ And I'm already in danger of brushing off encouraging words and Godly advice and discernment from genuine friends and authority figures.

ARGH! I want the real thing, I want Youyouyou and NOTHING else. I want it to be so real it's undeniable to everybody else. From lecture halls to bathroom stalls (!). I want to strip all this junk away and get to the core of this wonderfulstrangemysterious relationship.

This desire???it pounds in my heart it dries my mouth it waters my eyes???to dwell wholly and fully in You.
