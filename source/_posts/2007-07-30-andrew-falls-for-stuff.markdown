I've been home a week and I've been thinking about America. ("Home, and drinking the milk of prosperity," I joked with a few friends).

I think about how easily satiated I can be with _things_. No hard truths or intellectual finagling, please, just _Oprah_ sensibilities. I'll suffer the drivel of a nine-to-five to get cash to lay down at the altar of Stuff. There's something in the air here that dulls our senses beyond _MTV_ realities. It's a fleece that keeps us blind to our poverty: intellectual, moral and spiritual.

I could pick this up while in China, too: we'd meet folks who'd spend a good portion of their paycheck to upgrade to the flashiest cell phone and students with harebrained schemes to get an overseas education to guarantee success. It's somewhat ironic; not even an authoritarian government can stop the waves of _Materialism_ at the gates.

The irony cuts both ways. Here I am, claiming to know the One who promised to be the "Living Water" satisfying _every_ thirst, and just the other day I was out on [Dealnews](http://www.dealnews.com) for hours _fantasizing_ about assembling a new desktop computer. It wasn't the act itself that was Disgusting, it was the slimy feeling of not being able to Snap Out of It.

Essentially the setup is this: there is an infinitely beautiful, valuable Treasure whose worth is hidden in this world. If I believe _anything_ else is worth more, I cheapen the Treasure.

Jesus talked about not serving "God and moneyâ€¦you will hate one and love the other." It's the exclusionary tilt that gives me pause; if I ever think that I can chase both with equal gusto, then to some degree I believe the myth that Stuff Will Satisfy. It's just that in America, two-hundred million folks have proven this wrong.


#### So how do you cope?


How do we live unfettered from the idolatry of stuff? How do we refocus on the Treasure? I'm talking practically speaking, small steps, changes in attitude. Where do we start?
