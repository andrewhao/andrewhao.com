awesome three day weekend and i plan on doing absolutely nothing. okay so that's a little stretch of the definition.

what i do plan to do is get all those little projects running on the back burner finished. so i'm gonna be working on random website things, rereading AP books, cleaning my room  :!:  and working on some senior ads with the chem crew. yeah.. all in a day's work.

i've got a cell phone! write this down: **621-1907**. well it's my mom's old cell phone number but that's quite all right.

--edit

i just remembered something awesome that happened a few days ago. we were praying for **wes lin** at morning prayer cuz his family couldn't find a home in the area and he might have had to move. that very day his dad finds another home.. now how cool is that?! praise God yo.. that's some awesome provision right there.

i've been ripping myself apart with my insecurities lately and it's totally STUPID. there is confidence in Christ. there's security in his arms. it's time to face up to my fears and responsibilities and deal with them. cuz i've been running too long.
