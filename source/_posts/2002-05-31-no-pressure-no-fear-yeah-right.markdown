on my buddylist at the moment.. there are 21 people with away messages on, a good deal of which say "studying for SATs" "i'm screwed" "15 hours till..." "sacrificing small animals to the SAT gods" (kidding) and the like.

now that i think about it, i should've started studying like... oh.. three weeks ago?

well anyways.. who says that cramming is useless? i plan to force a whole year's worth of precalc and chem into my poor lil cranium in a span of 5 hours and 30 minutes (thats before my self-enforced deadline of 12:30AM).

you know what the main problem is? there's so much pressure to do well on the math2C test. i mean, if you didnt feel obligated to get a perfect 800 you'd be a lot more relaxed.. and conversely if you DID.. you'd get super nervous and bubble in every wrong answer. no pressure. no pressure. _who am i kidding?_

anyways, i plan to focus mostly on math (i'm gonna take the chem over again next year).. get that nailed down and i hope its all good..
