i'm going in. tomorrow at yerba buena high school i will enter that classroom with confidence, my head held high and my chest out because i am a capable, confident human being.

until that fatty SATII test packet slams onto my desk.

so yeah. take note kids, because if you ever wanna do well on a test, don't do what i've done. don't crack open your SAT2 writing prep book four days before you take this test and pretend you know how to do the test. cuz honestly, you won't. i'm sure not.

and now it's 11PM, i've taken two practice tests total in my life, i have no directions to the school tomorrow and i've in the general vicinity of screwdom. i'm gonna go sleep now.

kids, don't try this at home.

on a brighter note, the senior HC skit was a whole lotta fun! i love how we went all out guys.. that was really impressive. it's always crazy and insane and hectic the days before but man, in the end we pull it together like only 04 can. plus, guys wearing tight pants and flares - how can you lose? congrats to all on a **first place** finish w/ regards to the juniors and underclassmen... you guys were pretty bomdiggity too.

congrats to eugene berson and erica johnson on homecoming king and queen.. its an honor you guys deserve  :idea:

so on the overall side things have been crazy hectic, but a ton of fun. SATIIs will signal the beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning. either one.
