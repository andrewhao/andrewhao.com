i've been thinking recently and have come to the realization that i've been a horrible person because i continually put down engineers. as, you know, being dorky and unkempt with nobody staffing the social skills department. which is completely and indubitably true, but nobody said those things had to be negative. from now on, i compliment my fellow engineer as being "rugged" (two weeks without showers) "studly" (mastery of the compiler) and "pure awesome" (actually, that's just myself).

you know what we need? we need a hero. the Berkeley Engineering department needs a smoldering-hunk-nerd to rise above our lowly ranks and show the world what we're truly made of. he'll save the world by day and code by night. he'll put thick horn-rimmed glasses and pocket protectors back into style (or are they already?) and he'll even brush his teeth.

peter parker, wherefore art thou.
