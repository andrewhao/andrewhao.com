andrew young died yesterday.

unreal, no? when you think about it, you wonder _isn't t his the holiday season?_ isn't this all about giving and joy and the holiday spirit?

andrew young was four years older than me, but his life was actually cut short eight years back when his family got in a car accident on the way to school. he entered a coma and for eight years, has always been.

i remember visiting their house often, walking in his room and wondering whether the same young man i saw in the wheelchair, staring straight at the ceiling with glazed eyes and a permanant expression on his face once played NBA Jam 98 on his SNES like any normal high school freshman.

he did make progress as he began to respond to hand signals, his eyes made vague movements that suggested that he was on the road to recovery. he used to be wheeled into the youth services and stayed there in the back, quietly watching the service with us. we'll never know if he actually knew where he was and understood what was being saying, but i believed he did.

and i don't know.. i always assumed he'd come out of that coma. that someday he'd just wake up and be all right once again. and he'd be able to catch up on the eight years lost in his life. but i guess that wasn't the case.

andrew young came down with an illness just last week (i'm not sure which one), and he passed away yesterday afternoon at 5. i guess it was your time to go.

this holiday season, please don't take anything for granted.
