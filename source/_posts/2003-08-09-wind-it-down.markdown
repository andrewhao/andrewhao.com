five hours of sleep last night, three hectic days and a few crazy nights boiled into tonight. hope all you seniors enjoyed it.. i know it was worth it  :) thanks to all the help we received in decorations, from presenter couples, photographers and others. biggest props to andrew yip (who was here in spirit) and priscilla li (who probably lost a lot more sleep over this than i did), masterminds and all around brainchildren.

i've been riding an emotional and physical rollercoaster today and i'm pooped. tomorrow's a new day, but till then i'll **sleep**.
