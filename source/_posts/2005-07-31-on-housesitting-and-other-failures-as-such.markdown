So for the past two weeks I've been house sitting my uncle's home as they're off cruising the Alaskan coast.

Sounds easy? Let's not forget the fact that my uncle has got the gardener/zoo handler instinct in him. This is the man who's watching "Animal Planet" documentaries invariably every time I walk into his house. The man is a pillar of Nature Knowledge.

So hence, his house reflects that. To put it succinctly, his house is a jungle. Exotic herbs & plants, corn stalks, more fruit trees than I've got fingers. A yard pond filled with koi and Chinese plants, a fish tank and a trio of hungry parakeetes round out the collection.

In a previous episode, you may recall that [this happened.](http://blog.g9labs.com/index.php?page=showcomments&id=230) So I've already got a bad history there.

As of today, half of his plants are wilting, a couple have completely withered and dried up. Thankfully, no koi have goen belly-up (a bad case of deja vu). I did manage to kill two of his tank fish. Found them just chilling at the water surface, took a couple steps back and fought the urge to scream (or cry).

As of July 31, 2005, **Andrew's Official Failure List:**
1. Chinese school
2. Piano lessons
3. Baking
4. Taking care of living organisms.
