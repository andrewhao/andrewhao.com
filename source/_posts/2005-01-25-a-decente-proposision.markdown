New drive, new focus for this semester.

**A Decente Proposision**
If you fall asleep in class, it will be in the very front row. Cuz, you know, at least you tried.
Get the salad at every meal (save breakfast).
Ditto for the milk. Cuz guys can get osteoporosis too (!).
Run, dangit! Cuz the freshman fifty is hot on your tail.
See the needs of your friends.
Take every flyer given to you on Sproul and dangit, force a smile. Cuz it sucks to be rejected.
Look homeless men and women in the eye. Stop and talk. Cuz it sucks to be told you are dirt.

Curry is so freaking good. I don't even know why we hated on it in junior high.
