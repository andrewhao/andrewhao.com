so i woke up at 6AM to get over to lynbrook for see you at the pole.. haha yeah its amazing i woke up that early. it's pretty cool, cuz i had a minimum of hw that previous night and so i actually got some decent sleep.

but yeah.. see you at the pole was pretty awesome. i felt that we really gave the devil a smackdown (in laymen's terms) today. it was like.. perpetual happiness for the rest of the day. good stuff. what was really awesome was how we had all these people in the middle of the quad and we didnt care what other people thought about us (the weird people holding hands and singing ahhahha) yeah.. pray that God unify and put the body of Christ into action on this campus.. its gonna be an awesome year oh yeah...

physics. time slowed and everything disappeared and i was floating in an endless, timeless rift in some other dimension (punctuated by the bad jokes of mr wilson).

calc. test.. was all right (save a challenge problem i had no clue how to do.) i might actually skip tonight's hw. gasp!

xc practice was pretty tiring today. it was a food run to jamba juice (the one in Argonaut Center in Saratoga). yeah.. 6 point something miles total (and if you've ever run 3 miles with a slightly full stomach........ yeah.)

rushed off to piano class which was okay.. rushed back home and rushed (pattern?) to marching band practice at CHS. we got compliments from andy on a good rehearsal.. and that made me feel pretty good.

two of my friends had a pretty major.. incident tonight. the bad kind. gah.. it really hurts me to see them hurt. and the fact that both of them are my friends.. it's like i gotta keep my distance cuz i dont wanna appear to favor one over the other. yes.. its very complicated..

praying for you guys.
