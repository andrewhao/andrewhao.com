it's so easy to get into routine these days that you forget why it was exciting in the first place. i speak from experience, and this is only the third day of school.

i've already started to slack in bio and doze off in APCS. now when this happens on day 3, you know that something's gone amiss.

and the malady's spread past the academic factor. i can feel myself losing the passion.. the intimacy that i once held with God. and the worst part is that it's all my fault. where is the intensity? where is the childlike faith?

something's taken over me in the past day or two. and it's gonna take a lot of work and prayer to get past this. but till then, i've gotta get back into my devos like no other and kick into nerd mode. cuz i'm still here at lynbrook doing the student thang. and i'm not doing it too well (but trying).
