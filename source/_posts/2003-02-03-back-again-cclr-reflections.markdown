back from CCLR (xtian club leadership retreat) yesterday afternoon and i gotta say that it was awesome in so many different ways.. from the totally on fire, wacky people that we met to the worship to the food to the weird things we found we could do to each other and call it "fellowship".

so the 10 or so of us from Agape were stuck in Dorothy's 12-seat "bus" (much props to her mom for driving us up there and putting up with the noise :)). theoretically it takes about an hour to drive down there, but we got caught up in traffic and were victims of bad directions and ended up taking.. about twice that time. but it's all good.. that meant more time for backseat antics such as massive amounts of singing (stuck with all these choir people!), really dumb jokes, everybody yelling at jon to shut up :-), and trying to one-up each other in our fob accents.

but we did end up making it there (Camp Koinonia) and i've got to say that it was a nice place. clean restrooms really make all the difference.

but yeah.. we met all these awesome people from different schools.. seems as if everybody knew someone else from somewhere.. we all knew the same people. that was pretty awesome.. its like everybody was connected somehow - and we were :)

this weekend was filled with crazy antics.. from the cup tapping game (not tapping your cup twice when you put it down results in a mandatory public singing session), buckbuck (how many guys can you stack?), singing the wackiest songs, (Godly) wrestling (lol), bongo drumming, praise jamming and the like.

we decided to make up an Agape catchphrase/secret password that we'd secretly refer to and confuse the brains out of everybody else - _"zapzu"_. of course, nobody really agreed on the spelling so we ended up calling it "zebzoot" or "zapzoo" or like seung: "joobjoob? i can't pronounce it!" lol... we'd use it in so many situations:

1. two Agape members passing by
"ZAPZUUUUU!!" (chest thumping motion)

2. after wrestling
"phew, that's too much zebzoot for me"

3. at a meal
"hey _______, wipe that zapzoot off your face!"

4. for no reason at all
"your FACE is zebzu!" (followed by uncontrollable hysterics)

...and everybody else went **"huh?"**

lol.. but check it out: this retreat was so awesome because it was a time to really refresh yourself in the company of some of the most mature, on-fire people i knew. christine wrote in her xanga about how tough it was to be a leader (esp in her budding church).. sometimes it gets so tiring and you feel so exhausted. sometimes you feel frustrated by the way things are (or aren't) going. being around these people really felt like being around family.. feeling that _this is the way it's supposed to be_. and it gave me hope, you know? God's still working - at school, in Agape, at CCIC, in me and in everybody i see. sometimes its so tough to see what His plan for everything is.. but when you get a glimpse of it.. it's just awesome. i know i overuse that word so many times but seriously.. awesome is the word for it.

God's been planning big things for Lynbrook - there's no doubt about that. it's time that we as Christians on campus started to unite. not in the name of Agape and not in the name of some church. we've got to come together as God's fam. no, not just on campus. everywhere. it's time for us to drop down our differences, whether they be personal, racial, theological or whatnot - we've got to come together. Dale (our speaker) said that "did you know that nearly every revival in history was started by teenagers?" that blew my mind. it's time for our generation to take a stand. it's time to let GOd drop down a load of holy blessin.. not just on Lynbrook but to the nations. it's time to see Him move.

and i know that i'm on a streak for the longest blog entry ever. so bring on the pictures. wish i could've gotten in more pics in but my camera ran out of memory at the end  :( . oh well - whee!
