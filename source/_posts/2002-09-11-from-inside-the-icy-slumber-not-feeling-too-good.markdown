warning.. this blog is written under the influence. namely, the influence of sleeplessness. the following may or may not be an accurate representation of who Andrew Hao is in his current state of mind. now that we've gotten that out of the way...

i'm slowing down a lot here. here in my state of semi-consciousness.. i just don't feel right. i stumble through school without feeling much.. only tiredness. miles upon miles of running after school is wearing me out. marching band really kills you with painful forms and pushups to boot.

i'm just.. enduring the pain right now though.. it feels so weird. sort of suffering. no, suffocating. my physical being is drained. my muscles are sore (both upper and lower body) and i have meets to run. my mental state isn't much better guys. i'm totally out of it. not concentrating.. not focusing. i'm tuning everything out cuz i'm so tired...

i'm now even more dangerous in my car. driving 15MPH in a 25MPH speed zone.. eyes half closed and brain nonoperational. somebody take me off the roads. im a public menace.

today in piano class.. it was so bad. i couldn't concentrate at all.. and my teacher had me run through this part super slowly hands separately and i was SO BRAIN DEAD.. we spend like 15 minutes on a stupid 4 measures cuz my brain was just rejecting all this stuff. and i started to tear up (this happens to me guys.. i know i know it's pretty wussy). but it didn't hurt as much as it used to because i was so dead to all feeling. and my teacher realized it too.. probably when she noticed my eyelids drooping every 15 seconds. i really disappointed her today.. i could see in in her face. oh no not again..   :(

and today i was hit with the realization i was so screwed.. major projects in every class are due tomorrow. sigh.. this may be my first all-nighter.

_`GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH..`
i know i cant do this without you.. so please God.. i ask that you totally infuse me with your Spirit. God.. i'm totally dying right now.. and only you can pull me through this. i'm asking now. please._
