one thing i realized while running yesterday at the meet.. track's so much different from other sports in that there's almost zero hostility between teams. honestly, at the starting line it's all "good luck man" and palm slapping and generally positive stuff like that. totally different from your average sports. yeah that's right guys, it's all about love.

cept maybe garrick who keeps encouraging his sprint proteges to "work on the trash talk.. it'll gain ya a coupla seconds"  :cheesy:

anyways this weekend's gonna be super super busy from junior prom prep to prom to sunday worship and monster loads of homework.. it's gonna be a toughie.
