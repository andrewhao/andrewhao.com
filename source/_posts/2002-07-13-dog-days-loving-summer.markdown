so this is what i've been missing all along. i remember saying once that all i really wanted was to have one day with nothing to do, no responsibilities. something like that. and today was that day.. thought it was pretty cool. strange how some people can get sick of this...

woke up at about 12PM (after previously sleeping at 4 for some reason, i cant remember). got over to channing's at about 1 to prep for clarinet sectionals. today was pretty hot, so we brought along a cooler and some sodas to help relieve the heat. nearly our entire section showed up (well.. about 80% of them) which i thought was great. we separated the frosh from the experienced marchers and worked on the marching technique.

i was working with the frosh.. and i suppose it's a little frustrating at times. i mean when you look at the big picture and how you're supposed to convert these guys into amazing marchers by summer's end.. it almost seems hopeless. but i shouldnt be saying that.. our frosh are pretty quick learners.

lol.. channing had a far worse time with the experienced marchers. mostly cuz we're whiners. how true! haha they were complaining about the heat, the marching, blah and blah.. so we just decided to let em off early. heh.. i dont really blame em.

**cheapo alert!**
i save an empty burger king plastic cup to refill every once in awhile.

we stopped by the park across the street to hang with fellow CIA-ers. bit more people this time - and a way to get rid of the extra soda. hey, we could always use some extra people - tell me if you wanna come too (aherm victor li)..

CIA tonight we had a dating workshop.. haha it was sorta like a "loveline" type of deal. people wrote questions about dating, sex, love and all that stuff on papers and our youth pastors peter and thomas went through em and answered em all. to be honest, i thought i learned a lot from this/got stuff clarified:

1. girls/guys just dont have the same maturity level in HS - pretty evident, hm?

2. hollywood romance - DNE (limit notation), no such thing.

3. never look for a relationship - cuz you wont find one if you are

4. nice guys win in the end - well, those were in the words of wise ol kevin ip. "in the end, girls just want nice guys". hahaha i hope so

5. when a girl sleeps on a guy's shoulder, his arm falls asleep - that was according to peter. well **I** didnt know that! i must say that's pretty interesting. wouldnt mind it at first hehe.. then it'd be like "stop it girl! my fingers are blue!" - something like that

6. "real men cry" - according to thomas. good. i'll take note of that.

went over to the yan's house afterwards for eddie sy's bday celebration (16 NICE) and watched "a walk to remember". nice movie, i can see why it got (decently) good reviews. i liked the storyline a lot and felt that maybe it needed more closure? haha.. we were pointing out all the relationship blunders in this movie while they were still fresh in our memories

okay its time to stop boring you. post some other time.
