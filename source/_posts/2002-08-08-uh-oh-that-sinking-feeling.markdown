well.. last day of summer school today.. and that meant finals..

and being that i fell asleep on my bed before getting around to STUDYING, that meant...

i bombed 'em. HA! wheeee...

i dunno.. maybe its cuz i didnt expect too much out of this math class so i just got into slacking. i mean, no doubt i could've gotten an A. i realized that two weeks into the course. but i went into math 1B thinking that i'd struggle with it.. and that mentality stuck with me the rest of the six weeks.

anyways, we got our schedules today.. and it seems that i have a pretty decent one.

us history - battaglia
wind ensemble - felder
AP Chem	- haywood
physics h - coble
amer lit - seike
AP Calc BC - korsunsky
span 4 h - czerkawska

anyways.. we're all stressing out pretty badly already so far.. AP land here we come. Happy Fields Sanitarium, here we come.

but seriously.. i dont wanna let stress overtake me this year. i dont ever wanna let schoolwork ovetake my REAL priorities.. or even better.. i want to be able to prioritize AND get everything done. you know.

anyways, im off to bed. gnight.
