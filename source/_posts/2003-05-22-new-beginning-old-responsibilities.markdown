my newest cousin will be born tonight sometime in a few hours, if doctors predict correctly. dawg that is so cool.. if you think about it, a new life busts out tonight ready to take on the world. i don't know.. i'm lacking in the words. but what i do know is that now i have two sisters and four female cousins.. and zero males in my extended family. yes, that must mean something but i'm not too sure.

oh man.. God always provides.. shoot i've been witnessing a miracle unfold for the past few days. sweet, i like that. and did you think GOd doesnt care about club day? =D

sometimes speaking and talking won't do justice. sometimes what i feel in my heart causes its reticence, with an unwillingness to escape. there's a need to say something but the right words trip over themselves. and all that can form is a plea:

stop the drama, God. stop the division. you are the ultimate drama stopper. you can plug the holes that sink us.
