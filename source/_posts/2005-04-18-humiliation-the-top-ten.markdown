I've been thinking this through a lot. This is a list of **The Top 10: Ways I've Been Humbled This Year**.

10. High school rep means nothing anymore.
9. Jamming with Jason Wexler, the Bass God.
8. Realizing the female species is completely undecipherable.
7. Learning to break dance, and being shown up by eighth graders.
6. Utter humiliation whilst lifting at the RSF.
5. Realizing how shaky my foundation in the Word is.
4. (Trying) to make small talk in the elevators.
3. Riding a push scooter and wiping out twice in a week (to the delight of bystanders).
2. Girls.
1. Kicked in the nuts by my first grade tutees.

And it's darn good for me.
