They tell me that soup is one of the easiest things you can make: just grab a bunch of random stuff together and throw it in a pot to boil.

So I tried it out.

**How to live!**



	
  * Two stalks bok choy, diced

	
  * 1 carrot, sliced

	
  * 1 potato, diced

	
  * 2 leftover radishes, sliced

	
  * A handful of leftover mushrooms, sliced

	
  * 1 can chicken broth

	
  * Some seasonings. I just Googled this.




**Go!**








	
  * Pour in 1 cup water with the can of chicken broth and bring to boil

	
  * Throw everything in.

	
  * Wait.

	
  * Add some garlic salt. Some thyme. Don't ask me how much because.. I don't remember.

	
  * Wait Long Enough.Â When it Smells Tasty or your hunger takes over, serve over rice.




Not bad! On a chilly night like tonight, it really hit the spot. Hey mom, I'm gonna do you proud!
