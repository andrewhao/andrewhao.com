**i need** to stop sleeping like this.. that is, sleeping accidentally. it leaves no time for me to brush my teeth, which as you all already know is the number one cause for cavities and plaque formation and tooth rot and terrorism. so i wake up with a funky taste in my mouth and realize how mad my dentist will be. or happy i suppose?

but the real reason why is cuz it makes me feel irresponsible.. like i didn't have the time to actually get my day in order to finish all my business before starting another. but on the whole i'm sleeping so much more.. thank you senior year. i just need to plan on it.

i went to barnes and noble today just to read. i guess maybe it was to get inspired to write, cuz i've been so dry of ideas as of late. so it was pretty cool to just monopolize a couch and read some good short stories for a couple of hours.. and the fact that i was there not studying or buying anything must mean something. maybe that i'm a nerd, but that was pretty obvious from the start. but i'm happy to say i've got some new ideas again.

i wonder if my MIT interview guy will ever respond to me. i fired an email to him four days ago and he hasn't responded, which is worrying me because thanksgiving break is coming up which may mean that he's gone on vacation (i'll be gone three or so days for winter retreat). and by the time he's back, he'll be so inundated with calls and emails and interview requests that he may as well reply with big fatty "NOs". aye... it's my fault for replying to him so late. please take me please take me please take me. i wont be too boring!

wednesdays.. good mornings to sleep in. and so i shall.
