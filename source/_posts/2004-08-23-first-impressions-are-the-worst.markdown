Cal has been much better than i thought. this could be home: i'm starting to love this place (subject to change: classes haven't started yet.)

moving in was hectic for my unit, but the day after was even more hectic for the rest of the people. it's like feeling sorry for yourself when you bruise your knee, but then finding out someone else broke their leg. actually i'm gonna work on these analogies a little more.

you think your stuff can't possibly fit into half of a room, but then miraculously it does. i dunno, either the shelves are really big or else i'll end up running out of clothes to wear a couple of weeks into the semester.

living with girls on a floor and sharing a bathroom is going to be an interesting experience, as far as i can tell. the opposite gender i shall probably never understand.

seeing lynbrook people everywhere reminds me of high school again. i was talking to some SoCal people in the cafeteria and i guess it's a mixed blessing, definitely a blessing cuz i feel like i'm at home already. so thanks guys for being.. here.

yeah, i'm still doing the scooter thing. until i eat it bad one day, then you can send me cards in the ER.

i guess it's too bad: first impressions are unfortunately the most important. we'll give it some time.

--edit
i wonder what each of my floormates are going through as they get adjusted here. i can see some of the thinkers, partyers, loners emerge from each person. i think we're all lonely in some way -- some more than others.

mike zou, my roomate is a pretty chill guy. we'll get along.
