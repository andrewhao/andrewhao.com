It's been a heckuva week. Things have been moving quickly. There are events to plan and attend. Work has been piling higher. Group projects are scheduling themselves in (I'm in three this semester). Life, well, life is life: My car battery died, I lost my wallet and all my credit cards and ID.  I've been sleeping a bit less--those late nights in Soda Hall are taking their toll. Things would, at first glance, suck.

I haven't found myself stressed. I'm really happy. No joke.

I think it's something about perspective. Something about reminding yourself, "hey, I've got a roof over my head and easy access to food and amazing friends and family and a good heavenly dad." I have so many gifts; so many things I don't deserve at all.

It's about making priorities and keeping them. Admittedly, I'm terrible at this. But I think when life gets crazy you have to choose what is most important to you and stick to 'em. For me, that's time kicking it with the Father. That's having time to spend with Sarah. That's vowing to eat my meals at regular hours.

On the flip side, that means not burning the candle at both ends to get that CS project turned in. That means saying no to people and being okay with asking for more time.

So much of life is about balance (and some things are not--some you must go all out for. More on that in a bit). All this to say that I've been good. I'd like to be more regular about writing. I hope you'll stick with me on this journey.
