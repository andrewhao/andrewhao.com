so yesterday i saw this other girl riding a scooter on campus and i promptly fell in love. and maybe it's not because she was cute, but because it takes guts and a whole lotta swallowed pride and dignity to ride one of those contraptions.

I want to hear from you: what is the best pickup line and/or romantic act to sweep this girl off her scooter? make it good, guys. the cheesier, the better. my love life is riding on the line (pun not intended).
