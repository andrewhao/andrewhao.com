so the junior class went to moffett field today to volunteer for this weekend's airshow.

oh, so did everybody else.

combined, LRT, 2003 and 2004 made up about a third of all the concession stands.. which goes to show how dedicated and/or desperate we are.

business was decent.. but maybe it would've been better if we'd gotten a decent location. maybe if we were actually INSIDE the airfield. ahha.. well i guess there were still quite a bit of customers.

anyways we were across the fence from LRT and had some friendly competition going on there. didnt really see any 2003ers (until judy came over to mock us). but all in all.. i suppose this was pretty fun. i may go back tomorrow (depending on how sane i feel) during the afternoon.. we'll see.

but oh man, does my body ache.
