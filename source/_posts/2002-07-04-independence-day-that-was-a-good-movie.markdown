no, the entry title has nothing to do with the subject matter. thank you.

well it's july 4th and that means 2 things:

1. there's no summer school!
AND
2. there's homework!

it also means:

1. my dad's home!
AND
2. we get to paint the house!

whoopee!

yeah.. so paint we did. actually we painted the other house that we rent out. my dad kinda corralled the whole family and had us go paint the living room and kitchen. of course, this is the oversimplified description (being as i did a really incompetent job). who knew that paint could stick the way it does? i got paint all over my hands and fingers and sandals and face (sorta).

channing and i had to call up our whole section to get em to the info meeting we got this friday.. lol.. we're expecting just about half of the ppl to show up. sad? 4th of july weekend, we hope.

poor freshmen marchers this year, they're really gonna go through a whole lot more training over summer this year than previous years. wayyyyyyy more. weekly clarinet sectionals, 3+ frosh only marching rehearsals, 3 days of frosh band camp, then a full week of normal band camp. i almost pity them now =D

we went to faria elementary (which is across the street from de anza college) tonight to watch the fireworks display.. real nice. we've gone there every year for the past 4 years or so and it's always a great show. invariably my sisters would meet one of their schoolmates. funny how i never find any faria-ites from my year there.. hm.

i spent 8 total hours or so working on G9icon v5. hope you guys like it (IM me to see it).
