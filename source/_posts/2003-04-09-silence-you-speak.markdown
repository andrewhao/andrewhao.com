i have this urge to write something beautiful. you know, writing something brief yet puzzling yet so breathtaking and exhilarating at the same time. it's just eating at me. who ever knew? the intellectual fruit of Xangasurfing.

perhaps it was also a byproduct of reading the _Grapes of Wrath_.. to witness the way that Steinbeck boils the pain and that sheer sense of desperation exuding from 30s Americana down to a select page, or paragraph, or sentence - the very imagery that bursts forth in crystalline clarity and aims it right at your heart.

and i look at my own work and wonder why it falls flat on its face compared to these literary giants, these inspired poets of our Xanga generation.

and why's it eating at me? call me crazy, call me weird - maybe it's my inner softie - who knows? but man.

jus' gotta write.
