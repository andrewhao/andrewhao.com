After a whole summer of not seeing Mike, I bumped into him last Friday at the Asian Ghetto.

Mike's been receiving his disability payments and so has been off the streets for a good three months or so, but got kicked out of the program last month for missing a doctor's appointment. So he's been out on the streets again shaking the cup until he can appeal.

I bumped into him on my way home last Friday and told him I'd come right back out in a couple of hours to see him. "Thanks Andrew, I love ya," he tells me before I go.

I promptly forgot that evening. Dang. Haven't seen him since, but something tells me we'll bump into each other again.
