last day of real school. did it. finals are gone, projects are gone, stress is.. well.. kinda gone. but the point is.. i'm done (?)

i feel like i squandered my second semester. well, not squandered. but i feel like i worked it too hard for nothing. dude, i was still a grade-chaser, an overachiever, a nerd, you name it. I SLEPT IN A SLEEPING BAG ON A HARDWOOD FLOOR, UNDERNEATH MY COMPUTER (FOR THREE MONTHS) CUZ I WAS AFRAID MY BED WOULD MAKE ME OVERSLEEP AND FORGET ABOUT MY HOMEWORK IN THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING and for what? juniors, learn by example. work hard, but dont sacrifice your health (or your personal hygiene) for anything.

okay, no more self-analysis but only more end-of-the-year observations:

1) english AP final was today, involved a) a skit b) a shirt c) a food. i wont elaborate, but let's say the skit was good, the shirt wasn't so good (bad fabric paint and an MIT rejection letter) and downright disgusting food (i made ham sandwiches for _Hamlet_ and when i ran out of ham, switched to spam sandwiches which if we were reading a book called _Spamlet_ would be perfectly acceptable except we're not and Spam tastes downright puke-worthy). still, people liked the skit, liked the shirt, suffered through the food.

2) yearbooks were passed out today. i remember reading somewhere that yearbooks were on the decline at schools for some reason or another. judging by the clamor and the noise and the heightened emotions and frustrations and excitement of my fellow students fighting each other in line, i'd have to prove that article wrong. not here at least. i wish we had our yrbooks earlier so we could get underclassmen in our classes sign em before we leave next week for straight-up grad practice. i also think the yearbook censors went a little overboard this year, they ended up whiting out some perfectly reasonable quotes and statements on senior ads.

c) senior awards night packed the auditorium tonight, and even if i felt even worse for not getting any scholarships, i really began to appreciate the sheer talent that's present in our class at Lynbrook. it's crazy, so many brainy, artistic, eloquent, athletic people here. and i feel bad about not acknowledging people's accomplishments more, just taking em for granted cuz it was pretty impressive.

d) i dont normally do this (to-do-lists) but heck. assorted things-to-do before i check out tomorrow;
1. return band music =)
2. find mr. barnett, sign RFC
3. 20ish bucks for cap
4. vertigo gifts
5. find random things to return to teachers, i.e. Mr. West's BIO cd
6. get nostalgic over yearbooks

okay shuddup, i'm gone.
