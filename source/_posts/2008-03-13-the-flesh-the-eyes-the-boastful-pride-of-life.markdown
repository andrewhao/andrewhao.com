Lately, I've been looking to upgrade things: clothes, my computer & a new cell phone. I'm finding that techno-lust is exactly that: lust. It's dissatisfaction with what I have now paired with the incorrigible belief that the next new thing will make me happy.

It is difficult to live simply! It is difficult to simply live. How do you cope?
