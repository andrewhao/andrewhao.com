i've come to the conclusion that with the less sleep i've gotten, the stranger i act. and with all these weird sleeping habits i've been getting into lately.. that equals one weeeeirded out andrew.

you know how in our planner's there's about 15ish lines of space for each day? well i came home the other day, opened it up and realized that the whole thing was filled. no seriously.. every last major space was loaded up with stuff.

this did not bode well.

yeah..so the past few nights have been pretty darn sleepless (i'm running on about 3 hours per night for the last 3 nights).. makes me wonder why i sit here and blog and chat while i should be doing.. other stuff.

anyways track practice has been quite the tiring.. i think there's this part on the ball of the foot that's getting swollen cuz there's not enough cushioning.. my insoles are really thin and the shoes themselves have about 300+ miles from last xc season.. they're almost worn out. man.. i feel so slow and out of shape compared to the younguns like kevin sun (once a slacker, always a slacker) and luis jensen (now that kid is crazy). i promised PRs to myself this season, only time (and decent training) will tell.

saratoga-lynbrook joint wind ensemble concert is this saturday. man my weekends are so busy.. if i wasnt gonna do that then i'd be at the CSC rally in downtown SJ or at the all-comer's track meet at los gatos (yeah right.. get burnt like crazy).

we (morgan, hsiang, dan low and tim jou) went to valley fair today to go interview people for our spanish project.. shoot it's so hard to find people willing to be interviewed.. but when you find them, they're really nice about it. man.. when people open up to you, they'll really open up.. i met so many friendly people but yet at the same time i was **cruelly** and **heartlessly** shut down by so many people :(. man that's tough. get torn and shot down and you have to keep a smiling face. but its all good.. i understand where they're coming from. we hit up the food court afterwards and i gotta say that mcdonalds never tasted so good =D

we've invited people to come and pray for the budget cuts tomorrow @ the choir room.. yeah i think we can go out there with all that fanfare and rah-rah and speeches and demonstrations and stuff.. but what's the heart of God on this whole matter? not like those things don't matter - i'd be down there in the rally too. but i believe that God really does care a lot about this situation, how teacher's lives are going to be changed forever. so hey.. if it's wednesday night and you're reading this.. drop by the choir room tomorrow to pray for our teachers and our school.

aiyah it's 10:30.. i'm gonna get a move on now. homework is cool. YOU'RE cool.

_we take hard knocks come back for more
cause we're hardcore we fight for the One who died for (you)
and like Saigon we're on the frontlines
and we carry on to the end times

now that it's on we're out
in the front of this marathon with our armor on stay strong we drive on (drive on)
our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
and you know we don't stop_
**pillar - echelon**
