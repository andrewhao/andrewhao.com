Four AP tests: $340
Three AP prep books: $50
Foul-tasting energy drinks: $4
Showing up bleary-eyed to the test in pajamas and watching the words dance on the page: priceless.

tuesday's APCS test:  8O
thursday's APEnglish test: :roll:

not quite sure why i'm still taking these darn tests. if anything, i'm doing them out of guilt for wasting my parent's hard-earned cash.

i learned something last night: i'm incredibly driven. unfortunately, i'm driven by the wrong priorities. when i'm onto something i stick with it till the bitter, bitter end. let's just say that instead of studying for an AP test, i was working on a website. geek status > nerd status.

congrats to lynbrook runners who ran incredible times at de anza league championships today. see yall at the SCVAL meet. noteworthy notes included charles "the stud" chen PRing once again @ 2:07'00", garrick wong blowing away the 100m field, four lynbrook runners taking 1-2-3-4 on the 200m, and the F/S 4x400 pulling speed out of their butts and edging LG (i think?) for the win 8O

okay on a more insightful note, i'm realizing that i'm super messed up. i don't know how to love people, especially longtime friends. let me just say that i am bitter, and i've been holding it for far too long towards someone. it's tough to forgive, but God i need You to break my heart for those I need to love.

i'm making a habit to really pray for people.. friends, random people I see in the hallways. i'm not sharing this on my blog cuz i'm arrogant (please don't get me wrong) but i'm really trying to see people through God's eyes. sometimes i'll pass somebody on the hall and ask God "break my heart for him" and ask for taste of the pain they might be going through. cuz if i don't know the hurt or pain they're going through, how can I genuinely love them? **doode our God is a god of compassion **whose heart HURTS for the brokenhearted and the suffering.. i think it's our calling to share some of that compassion and LOVE.

i want to acknowledge the fact that i've probably been offending some people with constant references to spirituality and my relationship with God. if i am, please do talk to me, I'd love to hear what you think and just clear any issues up.

okay and on a final note, AP tests have been leaving me with more free time than ever. ergo, i've been creating more unnecessary activities for myself to eat up this free time which i so desperately need in the first place. that's beautiful.

"weapons of mass destruction" is fundamentally impossible (think law of conservation of energy). i've been wanting to tell that as a joke, but i figured it's gonna bomb anyways. GET IT shuddup.
