_For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven._


Sarah had always made light of the fact that I'm like a robot. After all, I work in code all day at my job. And I'm stable, familiar, and predictable. And I could always be counted on to "do the right thing." And often I have, how shall we say, _limited_ emotional capabilities.

When Sarah and I recently decided to break up after two and a half years together, we both felt strongly that it was for the best. Things had progressed to the point where we didn't feel it was right to move on. She didn't feel understood, I didn't feel accepted. We didn't have the self-awareness to pinpoint a growing uncertainty within. We had been through good times and bad, we were different. But at one point, we had piled up more distance and unresolved conflict than we could afford to handle.

I've spent the better part of the month trying to get inside my own head and put the words to what's really going on in me. It's been difficult to know where to start. The first day I was hurt and angry. The second, I was overwhelmed with sadness. The third, I was numb, and so on, in various little permutations. There are days filled with the humdrum of work, the supportive words of a good friend (perhaps you!) and tremendous freedom. And there are days where I'm honestly pretty miserable, mourning the loss of shared dreams and a companionship dear to my heart.

I've read it somewhere that men are often unfairly portrayed as emotionless; they simply don't know how to express what they feel. True; sometimes I feel that having a precise vocabulary and incredible emotional self-awareness will be the tools I need to heal. But if I let this go on too long, I'll never write. Of course, I say this with some embarrassment that what's coming out is completely overdramatic. But I won't apologize for that... yet.

And in some strange, kinda sick way, it's kind of nice to feel the pain and know that I'm not a robot. I'm skin and bones, joyously fragile, with little to boast about but the Father who loves me.
