Glen and I were discussing what keep us in that darkened dungeon, crunching away at our workstations and FPGA boards? Workaholism, no less. "We're chasing the high" we decided. It's an addiction, it's the very visceral thrill of solving a problem. And it consumes us, it hovers tantalizingly close. It's how "let's leave in 10 minutes" drags into a half hour, then one, then two. Success is a very seductive flirt.  
  
On a related note, I realized that I see life a bunch of milestones and things-I-gotta-do that I piledrive through, one-by-one. Everything else gets put on hold. I don't think I've stopped (long enough) for a good four years. No, this is not healthy.   
  
If success is a flirt, I'm the square.

I've struggled with this for a long time. My self-worth is not dependent upon my production. I want to know the rest in the Father's worldwide grace & sovereignty.   
  
And we cry Abba, Father.
