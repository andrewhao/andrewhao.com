okay.. so it's homecoming week and i'm swamped. barely any sleep, been awake since 4AM this morning. is it possible that i be awake for 24 straight hours? let's find out.

but enough of my whining, our hc backdrop looks pretty cool (and with the columns hanging down withi my beautiful work, it just looks even better  :) ) decorations are fine, and the skit is flowing really well. we'll just have to wait till tomorrow to see how juniors will rock the house (school?).

ahaha stephen chen from saratoga stopped by the quad tonight after toga's polo game vs us and his friends were just gaping at our skit rehearsals.. i guess hc isnt at such a large scale at their school. hehe.. i hope this is all worth it.

they want us to wake up at 5AM tomorrow.. but i think i'm gonna be humane to myself and wait till 6:30. early mb rehearsal too, have you ever marched in a toga? yeah i thought so hahahaa  8)
