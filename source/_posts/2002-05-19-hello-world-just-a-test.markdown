everything's fine and dandy i hope? i sure hope so. okay for now (assuming it works) this entire blog will be very messy.. and running kinda **slow**. but it's all good.. i'm running a new newspost/blogging PHP script (ashnews 0.83) using MySQL on backend.

my hosting service Portland Communications was being very stubborn.. so i just signed up for a new account. you'll notice that there are no banners, they give me PHP and CGI and even MySQL for free.. amazing

unfortunately you'll also notice that this (and my subprofile) load very SLOWLY.

so be patient.

please.
