anyways, this week's been Killer (with a capital K). i've been losing about 11 hours of sleep just in a mere 5 days! how horrible..

its not the schoolwork that's necessarily killing me..its the sheer amount of extracurrics i'm stuck in right now. XC, MB, piano, and this week i had like 3 appointments. but i found myself getting home at like.. 8,9, or even 10PM. i'd eat dinner, then crash on my bed and suddenly spasm out of bed (you should see me when i wake up in a panic: BAMMMMM straight UP) and wish it wasn't 2:30AM.

anyways yesterday was MB practice till 4. i missed **leslie** and **sue**'s wedding cuz of it (i cant believe i missed it! everybody says it was so.. heartwarming :cry: ) stopped by backdrop for about an hour or so and helped out with what i could.

anyways im working on both the XC and the Agape t/sweatshirts. phew.. its tougher than i remember them being. in any case, my friend **david luoh** over from SHS has some mad tshirt skills. check out his low brass t-shirt design: `[http://www.geocities.com/p3psi7/LBShirt.html](http://www.geocities.com/p3psi7/LBShirt.html)`

phew.. that is genius. i'm impressed and amazed. anyways tomorrow looks to be pretty fun. i'll post in another week (cuz no way i got time in the next four/five days  :( )
