i've become an expert at avoiding responsibility these days. as i sit here and type, i have a room to clean, 3 days of math hw to make up, a half week of piano to make up and a killer to-do list. and i dont wanna do a thing.

watched our fellow CCIC ballers play today at CHS.. we did all right (1-2).. but probably dont advance. oh well.. we won something right? hahaha.. 4 years of straight losses and finally we win something! oh wow..

watching all those guys kinda made me wanna get back into basketball again. yeah.. i kinda regret quitting my old basketball club. i saw a few guys i used to know.. they got mad skills now.. haha.. i'm jealous. yes i am.

every weekend from now on i'll be super busy.. marching band practices, 2004 fundraising volunteering at moffett field airshow.. CIA beach trip. which isnt a bad thing.

er.. im getting guilt trips now. i'll write up some more later. and i'd fill out one of those spiffy survey "you-are-so-and-so" thingies.. when i have the time. yeah.
