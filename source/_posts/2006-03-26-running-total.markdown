Dang, that's a big yellow house.

**Monday**
Woke up after 14 hours of sleep. My room is freezing, but heck, 14 hours! I feel good.

Most of today is spent reading in research for my History 7b paper on the Oxnard Beet Strike of 1903 and the formation and quick demise of the Japanese Mexican Labor Association. Okay, so the topic isn't exactly sexy. And doing primary source research is giving me a headache. But it sure beats coding.

Get distracted for a few hours researching [HDR](http://www.flickr.com/groups/hdr/) and how I can get it to work on my low-end consumer camera (a Dimage Xg). Take a couple of test shots and, nope, it ain't gonna fly.

Yesterday my mom took me to this Chinese physician who tugged and pushed and pulled and snapped cracked and popped my ankle from every which direction. I tried to hold in my tears, I really did. Man, I hope this works.

I got these tape strips coated with some.. herbal substance that does.. something. Thing is that I need to have them on for 12 hour durations. Thing also is that the sticky stuff is really.. sticky. Thing is that my leg has hair. And that hair comes off when the tape comes off. OWWWWWW

**Tuesday**
Woke up early today to overcast skies. Got some FAQQLY work in before lunch, then headed to Chipotle to grab some lunch. Hoped to get some good photos over at the Stevens Creek Reservoir, but instead it started to rain and I settled for a patchy field off the road.

I'm watching EE40 webcast and let me tell you, semiconductor physics and pn-junctions are the last things I want to be hearing about right now.

[Julia asks](http://www.xanga.com/lycheee/464277418/item.html?nextdate=last): How do we make good siblings (in the family of God sense) to each other? Shoot her your thoughts.

**Galatians 5**. Wow, I need to just let this sink and soak. It's ironic how hard it is to live in freedom (I find this especially true as an Asian American). "The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love." What the heck does that look like? FAITH expressing itself through LOVE. Not necessarily through WORKS or whatever gets tangled up in there. Freedom! Man, I want to experience it truthfully and deeply.

Headed over to [Overflow](http://www.xanga.com/overflow_collegecareer) fellowship tonight and man, I forgot how much I missed these folks. Had a good study with a lot of the new guys. I've got a good feeling about this group.

**Wednesday**
Working hard on FAQQLY (gonna hit a deadline this afternoon.. gonna hit the deadline, gonna hit it).

[![the obligatory desk shot](http://static.flickr.com/50/120091450_e4b36aac23_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/14345088@N00/120091450/)
This is my desk setup right now.

**Cognitive dissonance**: Haha freakin' social psych. Caught myself trying to justify time wasted in line today and remember thinking.. "hey, this is cognitive dissonance!" So cool when school and life collide.

**Thursday**
Optometrist appointment early in the morning (I'm switching to normal contacts now, after years of corrective contacts). Lunch with Allen Chang where we reminisced on where we've been and how dang fast time flies by.

Swung by Target and bought a vacuum machine for our poor apartment, which has not been vacuumed ever since we moved in (yeah we know, grossss). And a toilet sink bleach pill. Gross.

FAQQLY all afternoon. The thing's shaping up well. Feeling productive, but I've got to start reading and studying for school again. Man, methinks this workaholicism comes from my Dad.

_I long for your water / Brings life to me / I long for Your truth Lord / Sets my heart free_

**Friday**
Your thoughts? [Senators debate fate of illegals.](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-03-29-senate-immigration_x.htm)

And, [A whole lot of brave kids.](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/14235419.htm)

Jack and I went out today in search of dollar fish filet burgers (foiled). That was fun.

**6:40PM**: Okay, I admit it. For the past two hours, I have been in a rut. Doing the online equivalent of bumming around, daydreaming, hesitating, avoiding the things that need to be done. Like writing in this blog, for instance.

**9:00-11:00PM** Get around to tweaking [www.campuschurch.net](http://www.campuschurch.net) with the updates Jaeson requested months ago. It's pretty incredible how far I've progressed as a coder and designer. The campuschurch design, while somewhat visually pleasing, is a mess in terms of code structure and layout. It's so ugly I can barely even look at it anymore.. it's tabled and inline styled like no other (I admit I used Frontpage in the development process.. no more). I think it's because I sliced the layout and directly relied on ImageReady's table layout of the graphics. Should have sliced smarter and done hand-coding and placement.

I admit I didn't think very far through in terms of extendability and flexibility (the flash menu is a pain to update, and the custom graphics need to be re-photoshopped every time a section is added). I've learned so much more about the Box Model and semantic code technique since.

I'm listening to Blackalicious' _The Craft_ CD and, goodness, it's funky in a get-up-and-dance sort of way.

I was reflecting on my spiritual growth this year and I realize I still have so much to go. I remember one distinct reason why I wanted to join prayer team was so I would learn how to talk to God and rest in His presence. Now the ironic thing is that I do these things, but only on the "appointed" days and times when prayer team meets. When I'm by myself, I can find a million other things and excuses to tell God and convince myself that I have more pressing, important things to do.

I want to be a man who knows God's heart intimately. I want to have Scripture BURNED into my heart. I wanna listen and HEAR. To do so, I need to work a lot on the 'quality-time-with-God' part. And I know God's working in a myriad of different ways, but I think my current attitude towards God really.. disregards every beautiful thing He is ya know? I want to work on that.

**Saturday**
Simple things make life good.

Driving a car.
Lunch with a good friend.
Clouds straight out of a painting.
Good buys from Goodwill (I <3 that place)!

**g9Labs* Facelift**: I thought it would be fun to see what I could throw together as a new placeholder for [www.g9labs.com](http://www.g9labs.com/) in an hour or less. I had the basic design done quickly, but wanted to push it further (alas, no more time). Yeah, the copy text is a tad lame, but who's actually going to read it? You'll notice the color scheme is very much inspired by clothing articles hawked by various youngspersons' clothings stores (e.g. Hollister, Abercrombie). Ah, spring, when a man's fancy turns to thoughts of ________.

**Sunday**
It's a return to Berkeley. Glad I got to see (the few) folks I did over break. You are all beautiful people (inside and out). Glad to get a lot of important things done. Glad I struggled a lot apart from tight community and learned a little more about who I am. Glad for a God who doesn't fail. Glad to do some housecleaning (haha). Good stuff.
