Home just smells good,
Among other things

Homefries, let's chillllll

**And now for a string of uncentered and certainly unfocused bulletpoints**,




  * Grades all got back yesterday. OUCH. So good, so good (Hear that? That's my ego shriveling.)


  * **Zounds!** I've been sleeping so much it's unnatural. And feeling pretty guilty every time I wake up.


  * Man! I hate xanga browsing. The longer I look, the more uncool (in the MTV sense) I realize I am. Maybe that's all right, but for the time being it's pretty depressing. Hey, shut up, I'm trying to be real here okay?


  * The scale of humanity is pretty staggering. Opening the newspaper today (for the first time in a semester) got me thinking about it: racial tensions, unjust systems, false lies and doctrines, hunger/starvation/famine, materialism & mediality, globalisation and more blarghsdlfkejfsd. Dah. Speaking as a student: I'm pretty sheltered. Speaking as a person: I'm pretty overwhelmed.

You'll laugh but I want to do something about... something but there's nothing more laughable than unfocused naivete. My God, we're so broken. Man, how do people not get jaded about these things. Rose-colored glasses anybody? Cuz there's plenty to go around.


  * On a different front, I am letting folks know that I am home for virtually the entire holidays, working on the FAQQLY social networking project and, when not, sleeping like a log. But I'd love to see y'all again! That's my resolution: meet with everybody again in (wonderfully awkward) social situations.

There is, of course, a possibility of visiting you folks in Southern Cali when y'all start school again (foooooolios). I'll just show up unannounced and tag around like the kid nobody invited to the birthday party.


  * Really, I'm a mass of seething insecurities (or am I a seething mass of insecurities?). Kind of something I'm trying to work through these days.


  * DO HARD THINGS. This is my motto (not that they mean anything).


  * I was defeated yesterday. In a hard-fought battle, dragging to the one hour mark, I made my best attempt to park at Valley Fair. Bruised, battered and certainly quite a bit more surly, I left dejected. Andrew: 0, Holiday Traffic: 1.


  * Goals this break: compose a song, write _anything_
