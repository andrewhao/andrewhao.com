ah.. 3AM and i've got a big list sitting on my desk that says "**TO DO**" and below it.. a ton of unchecked items...

anyways, listening to the **yao ming mix** really made my day (er early morning).. it's enough to make any asian guy wanna go stuff a rim or something  :)

**Vanessa Carlton - A Thousand Miles** really is stuck on my playlist.. it's got such a relaxed-yet-epic feel and groove to it.

well those are my random musings for now.. track meet tomorrow and you bet my spikes will be all laced up, the air crisp and my rear end ready to get burned once again. ah, the memories.
