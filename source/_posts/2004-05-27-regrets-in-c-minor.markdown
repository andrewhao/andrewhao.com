i came across it on accident. beethoven's pathetique, c minor on internet radio.

i spent six months on that piece, two years ago. was supposed to have performed it, mastered it, conquered it, two years ago. instead, i turned and buried it, two years ago.

i wasn't even close to playing it like the way it was recorded. i can imagine it: black tuxedoed pianist slender fingers flying over pure ivory keys. mine were always a little too chubby, a little too slow and tended to trip over themselves.

too bad i never continued. my mom's in the other room humming along to the melody, a melody she's heard millions of times in her own house, albeit imperfectly.

i will never understand why my parents poured those thousands of dollars into my piano education for (what?) or why the nostalgia is so strong and the heart so heavy (now?)

some destinies you try to refine and build up. some you work up halfway, they crumble and you cry over the loss. but what can you do? melody so lovely, music so fine, cannot (at least not today) ever be mine.
