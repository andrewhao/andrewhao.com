I went running on the fire trail this morning. My fingers and thighs were frozen solid (but man, was it worth it).

--

On my way up, I pass this dark-skinned middle-aged man walking down the trail. He's wearing a flannel jacket, hoodie turned up way over his head, looking a little disheveled with a full salt-and-pepper beard.

But get this. He sees me and doesn't just laugh. He _cackles_, "HA HA HA HA HA" with clear, enunciated pauses between each "HA".

I stay on the other side of the trail and redouble my pace. He's still cackling when I'm far around the next bend. Good thing it's not evening time, because I have no interest in being part of the next slasher flick.

--

I love running, not just because of the feeling of accomplishment or the health benefits or the runners' high. I love it because it's so mental. I love the beautiful understanding of breath, life, need, Jesus, oxygen, _perseverance_.

--

On the way down, two dogs bound up the trail past me, no owner in sight. The two joggers in front of me turn around, hands on their hips, and watch the dogs lope uphill. They have these quizzical expressions on their faces (confusing me at first, because I think they are for _me_).

I mentally kick myself because that would have made an awesome photo... dogs with their tongues hanging out of their mouths, not a care in the world except for open trail and a hill to climb... hikers thinking _I'm gonna have to chase those dumb mutts down_.

The fire trail takes a 90 degree elbow about a mile in, turning into a steep slope. At this point I'm usually pretty winded and usually struggle to make it to the top. I mentally resolve to make it.

And this is pounding, over and over, in my mind:

_I must know you. Beautiful Jesus, I must know you._

And the sky turns to fire and I can see him in my mind's eye, the Treasure, the Reward. The dull ache in my legs is spreading and the spots are already appearing in my peripheral vision. But the King and the Father is there and he's smiling.

Everything else is irrelevant. Everything else is a molehill.
