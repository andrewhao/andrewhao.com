twas one of those good days. twas one of those full days. twas one of those days you look back and go "oh dang, i got absolutely no work done (and it's quite all right)"

**true fact**: i'm super goal-oriented. from right around birth (i popped out clutching a Day-Runner(tm) in one fist and a Palm Pilot(tm) in the other). but the fact of the matter is that i beat myself up if i don't get everything on my to-do list checked off. thus explaining the lack of sleep in high school, because 24 hours in a day just ain't enough.

that explains why i'm still catching up on math homework 3AM sunday morning. but i digress. today...

10AM: up and at 'em. to the RSF where the gym is still surprisingly empty and ball a little with IV guys jon allen and jeff. humiliation (on my part) ensues.

11AM: the dilemma: a need to burn off about 120 excess meal points off my card. the solution: eating with diana lee and michelle park at crossroads. omelettes have never tasted so good, the french toast is amazing; mixing the two has slightly less spectacular results.

1PM: mock chemistry midterm. i used to think chem 1A was a breeze because i was a Lynbrook Chem Studmuffin and thus i didn't need to read the book and do any practice problems. so i didn't, and now taking this test proved that i was less stud and more muffin.

2PM: Operation Christmas Child box packing with IV (these boxes are filled with toys and necessities and shipped to kids in third world countries as their christmas presents where they would normally be getting nothing). made me realize how freaking blessed (spoiled??) we are here in the US. how can a cheapo superball or a handful of candy or a simple t-shirt or a set of crayons make any kid happy? (and then you get thinking and it makes you a little ashamed).

**a slight tangent:** they should outlaw the playing of christmas music before thanksgiving, at least.

5PM: sarah lam invites us to her birthday dinner in some fancy schmancy buffet restaurant in SF. my stomach did a couple of backflips, the Running Man and a couple of other dance moves upon seeing the food (think: todai, to the next level). and it wasn't even the food: she had goshdarn goodie bags afterwards with assorted fruit snacks and flashing light apparatuses (apparati?) too. oh yeah, happy birthday sarah. what was cool was talking to her parents and seeing the close relationship they had with sarah and her sister. it checks out, in my book. very impressive.

what was also awesome was bonding with some small groupies to and from the BART station. i'm a little worried we'll get to know each other too well and we'll start getting sick of each other. might be a little too late

so tonight i told myself i'd finish a fat math assignment and get 100 pages into a book. 3AM and i haven't done either.

it's been awhile since i've written an absolutely pointless entry: sweet.
