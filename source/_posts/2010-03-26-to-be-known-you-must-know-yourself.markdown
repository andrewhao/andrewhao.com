I am learning that there is a responsibility to being known by another. Sarah and I can't expect to read each other perfectly right off the bat. Nor can we coast off the years we've been together. 

I am only starting to learn about myself. Really. There is work to be done that I've simply ignored for years. And it's kind of exciting! What motivates me? What makes me mad and why? Why am I the person I am? It's so freaking easy to do the daily routine thing: go to work and come back, fill your life with activities and people and events and commuting that you don't have time to stop and think and just listen. 

They say communication is a two-way street, and I'm only figuring out that there is much more to plumb from the depths. And it's good for the two of us. If I can explain myself and my feelings and motivations better, then Sarah has more than assumptions to go off on.

And at the same time I realize that this journey of self-realization can be twisted into an exercise in navel-gazing. May I know myself not to make myself more than I really am (a twisted shell of the Original design), but to communicate with ever-more honesty.
