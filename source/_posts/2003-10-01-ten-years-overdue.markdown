today, i was a kid again, sprawled on the backyard lawn staring at the pastel sky and feeling the breeze whip over the grass. time stopped as it only could for a 9-year old and there was nothing to worry about, just that feeling of _being _and the ticklish prickles of overgrown grass.

yes, i was a kid again. at least until my mom came home with keys to get me back into the house i got locked out of.
