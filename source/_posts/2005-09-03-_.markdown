There's something about tears that really moves me. You?

I watched my youth pastor, Thomas, get married today. At some point in the ceremony, here were tears sliding down his face. His best man was reading his letter to his parents, aloud and off to the side. Thomas kept dabbing his face: the left eye, then the right, and then the nose, in consistent rotation. Left, right, nose, pause, left, right, nose. The voice continued its rhythm over the loudspeakers, Mom and Dad beamed.

Left, right, nose, pause: but we couldn't see the tears because of the dim lights. Nor could we hear the sniffs, because the music hid it all behind guitar strums.

And I, ten rows down, was bothered because I tried to process what he was feeling and I couldn't come up with an equivalent. Like my emotional quotient was too dull to recognize the reaction. Kind of like grabbing for a word you've never learned.

And I kept watching the handkerchief move and wishing I knew what it was like for Thomas. But man! Tears are a funny thing because they invoke in you what no love song or slow jam ever could. To see them come down the face in anybody: a loved one, a friend, a complete stranger, puts you through the same feeling (at least a close approximation of it). It's an invitation to a shared experience.

It's funny, sitting here wanting to write something powerful but knowing I can't. Like a year of craziness has corroded the link between my heart and the pen.
