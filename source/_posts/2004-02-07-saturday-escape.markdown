today was one of the better ones.. my first real saturday off =) great weather too (it was supposed to rain?) so i headed up to fremont older park to do some biking on the hills. it felt really good to be back in action again, after two months of straight up pigging out. i'm going to need to be hardcore with my training now, the underclassmen track runners are working like crazy. having started a bit late and injuring the ankle a week ago, i think i'm going to need to do workouts 7 days a week. or so i tell myself. five days of running, 2 days of cross training. yeup.

went directly to **charles** and **angela's** birthday BBQ right after that. it was awesome stuff, got to iron chef it out with richard at the grill (sorry about the cancerous food, guys). great weather, great friends, altogether muy bueno. happy birthday you two! here's a photo:

and finally tonight was the jazz concert (my first and last in my lynbrook career), and also james kim's last  night in the USA. i left wishing i had gone to more jazz concerts. seriously.. i was impressed. and i don't know james kim personally, but it's definitely sad to see him go (he had an impressive solo piece tonight)

and i think that in all our minds, we were thinking that that would be us in about four months. it's scary, isn't it?  :cry:

i was inspired by the concert. jazz piano.. that's something i want to try learning. i think i'd enjoy it. as a means of escape? i just need to know what i'm escaping from.
