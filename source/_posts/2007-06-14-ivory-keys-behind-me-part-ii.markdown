Four years have passed and today I sit down at our old Yamaha upright and open up Khachaturian's Tocatta. It is one of the few pieces I recall playing.  
  
My fingers recall their positions quicker than I expect, and I remember banging away at Tocatta, a fast, furious and highly technical piece sophomore year in high school. I loved playing it because it was complex and fast. It was loud, then it was deadly quiet.  
  
I used to play this piece furiously and more physically than I had to as a way to take out my frustration at the keys and retaliate at Natalia. Ironically, she loved the performance.  
  
Tocatta is not a piece for listening. You can only enjoy it by playing it. On some sections my fingers moved so fast I felt I was flying, then I would sink back into swirling polyrhythms and 10-tuplets. I loved the pure physicality of the piece.  
  
So this afternoon I haltingly play it again, balking at the sheer technicality of it all. Time relaxes my fingers, and I gather the nerve to play each section quicker and quicker (but never too fast lest I taste bittersweet memories).
