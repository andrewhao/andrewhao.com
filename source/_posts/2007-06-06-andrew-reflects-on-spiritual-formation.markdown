"A church needs legs and wings," says my friend Dan. "Legs to keep us firmly grounded in terra firma, wings to experience the Divine."  
  
This was a year of developing legs. I spent much of the beginning of this year asking hard questions and [examining the foundations](http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/565211780/on-me-pour-out.html) of my faith. I've been catching up on theology and really digging deeper into the Word, getting a fuller intellectual grasp on my faith. Dang, it's been amazing.  
  
But I think I'm ready to grow some wings. Faith as a somewhat academic exercise is rather hollow. Part of what I've lost in these latter years is a sense of wonder, a child-like trust and my big dreams in a big God.   
  
Joy! That's what I miss. Simple, delirious joy being with Dad.  
  
That's what I'm pressing into this summer. Knowing the Father. Meditating on the beauty of the Gospel. Just kicking it with Dad. I can't believe it's so simple.
