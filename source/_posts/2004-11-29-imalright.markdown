coming back to school was the worst thing ever. it was chilly, my head was naked and in a grand gesture that misery really does love company, i found that i had exponentially more work to do then when i left. they are multiplying like rabbits, rabbits that come from alien motherships and are genetically engineered to grow little baby homework rabbits out of their left hind foots.
feet.

had a good talk with my dad yesterday. he's more calm about this career confusion than i am. i needed to hear it from him  :)

short hair is great. people notice less when you skip showers.

i am going to skip lectures this week to catch up on much-needed work. at least that's what i tell myself. smart thing to do two weeks from finals?

i have spent 20+ hours and almost 10 pages on a stupid paper and have managed to say nothing. not certain whether to be worried or be proud.

i'm tired of living day by day. i'm learning to breathe, learning to crawl, learning that you and you alone can break my fall...
