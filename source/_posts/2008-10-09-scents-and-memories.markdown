Sarah and I were talking about how scents are strongly associated with memories. A few of mine:



	
  * The scent of redwood bark: This reminds me of being off at various retreat sites in Santa Cruz and the memories of friends

	
  * The scent of the first rain: Doesn't it just make you happy?

	
  * The scent of eucalyptus leaves: Walk through the IAS buildings (the courtyard between the Campanile and Barrows) and take a whiff. No real memories here; I just really like the scent.

	
  * Crisp night air and the faint whiff of food cooking in somebody's home: This reminds me of when I was a kid and my family would drive through the neighborhood during the holidays, watching for Christmas light displays.


What are your favorite scents, and what memories are they associated with?
