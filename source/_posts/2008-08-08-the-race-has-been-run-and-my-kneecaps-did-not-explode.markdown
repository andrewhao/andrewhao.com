What a feeling: crossing the finish line at 26.2 under the Bay Bridge in incredible agony, a massive sense of relief and food, glorious food waiting for you on the other side.

What a feeling: running in a huge sea of people, making conversation with strangers, wondering what their stories are.

What a feeling: crossing the Golden Gate bridge at 7 in the morning, the wind blowing you about and the North Bay illuminated by shafts of light running through the clouds. The eucalyptus trees frame the coast perfectly and insulate you from the seaside gusts.

What a feeling: high-fiving strangers, gulping down energy drinks and carb gel at random intervals. A random Trojan warrior shows up here and there running in full armor.

What a feeling: running through cramps over the last 8 miles, your face contorted in every possible way (and [ruining all of your photographs](http://www.marathonfoto.com/index.cfm?RaceOID=27892008M1&LastName=HAO&BibNumber=7586&Mailing=16254)), your mind turned to mush and all higher-level mind faculties shut down, leaving you to just run and breathe and ignore the pain.

What a feeling: cramping up and faceplanting a mile from the finish and having three guys come to your help. One of them offers you salt tablets, his energy drink and runs with you a short distance making sure you're all right.

What a feeling: feeding off the energy of thousands, people running with various disabilities, running for causes. You bump into a few other runners with IJM t-shirts and you swap stories.

What a feeling: tears forming in your eyes; you wonder if it's because of the pain or if you're just really that emotional.
