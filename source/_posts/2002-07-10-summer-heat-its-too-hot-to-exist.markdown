i opened the newspaper today to the weather page and saw that there was a big ol 101 degrees forecasted for today. well whoopee.. that's just swell. you see, when it gets hot, there's two things i do:

a) whine.
b) whine.

..which probably isn't a good thing. hehe.. i totally isolated my room from light. curtains drawn, skylight blocked and YET it still simmers in there. mannn.. thats no way to be doing hw in 100 degree heat.

went to church for our weekly youth group activities (we meet mon/fri at rainbow park, wed at CCIC-san jose 1-5PM. itd be awesome if ya guys could come =D) and i beat the heat thanks to the modern day invention known as A/C!  the guy who invented it deserves a memorial. wowie.. i could write poems and poems about air conditioning.. but i'll get around to that later.

i did some meager piano practice and, as usual, went to piano lessons to get my ego kicked, my self-esteem flattened, my self-worth soiled and my guilt intensified. yeup. thats how it works.

hope its not hot this friday.. poor clarinets get to do marching practice out on the quad. ouch? tell me about it. i'm thinking of bringing some soda or something.. or maybe a giant cooler that afternoon.

my tires came this afternoon.. but we didnt get wheel nuts/locks yet. gonna need to go out to sears or maybe wheelworks and get a set.. i hope its not too $$$. hehe.. my 0% rice accord will become 15% rice accord soon. nice.
