actually i didnt think of anything too deep. ah well.

in any case, during calc yesterday morning, our teacher finally came back from a weeklong absence due to some sort of sickness she didnt specify about. but she was explaining to us her health condition at the beginning of class.. "for those of you who were wondering.. the left side of my face.. is paralyzed.. its only temporary but.." and then she broke into tears. she looked and sounded fine.. minus the fact she was crying in front of about 70 students. yeah.. we were all feeling really bad for her but she seemed to handle it pretty well.. and got back to normal pretty fast. i wonder what could cause your left face to go numb? wisdom tooth surgery? who knows? hrm.. its always interesting to see your teachers to show their human sides once in awhile.

spent a few hours this afternoon putting new speakers into the rear deck of the car. hm.. i cant really tell a difference but that may be because my head unit is still stock.

i finished watching a korean romantic comedy "my sassy girl" (english subtitles, of course) this afternoon, wondering what all the fuss my korean-popstar-obsessed friend was making. hm.. i gotta say it was pretty good. its about how this guy meets this drunk girl on the subway and how strangers think that she's his girlfriend after she calls him "honey". so he decides to help her out. finds her a place to stay that night and etc etc. turns out that she's a lot more than she seems.. very.. feisty. anyways the guy goes through a lot of abuse.. haha his facial expressions throughout are hilarious. and the ending turns out a bit more poignant than i'd expected.

while we're on the subject of female (or even male) korean popstars:
**THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN ADMIRATION AND OBSESSION.**
thank you, that's all i have to say.

slept all through this afternoon, felt guilty cuz i didnt get much of my work done. i gotta stop doing that.
