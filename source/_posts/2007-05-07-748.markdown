Jesus, be my Satisfaction. It's hard to know that, ya know? Sometimes I feel an emptiness in all the wonderful things you say about yourself and myself in you. And I wonder: is it you? Or is it me?   
  
It's me.  
  
I'm anxious. I crave approval. These are my weaknesses, and I daily wrestle with the latent fear that perhaps I seriously missed something that our MTV peers said. I'll chase those phantoms forever.  
  
You whisper, you swell in me and I remember. Sometimes I literally feel a flood of relief pour over me. Sometimes it's an uncontrollable giddiness. Sometimes it's not an emotion but a silent wave of peace where my being cries, it is well, it is well with my soul.
