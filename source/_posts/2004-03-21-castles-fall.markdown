it's been coming along for some time
but you trust too much in yourself
and when it doesn't work out
and when those sand castles fall
it hurts.

**man, i'm so foolish**. i'm still insecure. i thought i trusted it all to You, but i guess i've got a ways to go. give me time, won't You lead me.

sorry i'm being so abstract. some things just can't be articulated right.

_fare thee well
trade in all our words for tea and sympathy
wonder why we tried, for things that could never be
play our hearts lament, like an unrehearsed symphony

but it???s not the way
that it has to be
don???t trade our love for tea and sympathy_
