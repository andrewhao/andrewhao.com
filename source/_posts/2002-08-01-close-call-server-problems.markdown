props to **kalvin wang** for hooking me up with some profile space.. mostly due to the fact that my port5 server went down over the weekend. anyways i'll be at arabiafish hosting temporarily at least until i can get a (probable) final move in.

oh, i managed to screw up my MySQL server too.. but thank goodness i remembered to backup my data the night before (relief).

enjoy.
