welll this week's almost over.. thank goodness. fridays feel so good (even though this week i probably lost more sleep than i ever have). but i won't talk about (my lack of) sleep. because i know you dont want to hear about it ahha..

marching band played at the football game tonight.. it was nice cuz we WON the game! wow! not to mention 24-0 shutout against poor ol monta vista. ONCE IN A LIFETIME. thats all i have to say. the field show was pretty good (but that was probably because i wasn't paying attention to other people's marching) and i'm actually pretty excited about this season. it's all downhill from here so it's all good.

yeah.. football game tonight caused me to miss Praise Night over at CIA.. man! i heard it was an awesome night.. and i hope that it really prepares us for the **Go Tour **done by YWAM in two weeks (outreach night! come come come!) yaaaa talk to me for more details  :)

daniel lui invited me to his church SJCAC for a speaker that he says is awesome.. so i'll be meeting up with him for lunch. i've got the feeling that God wants me to go to this thing.. that he wants to tell me something? we'll see..

well after the game i got home and played some starcraft with jon kang.. oh man i stink now. well i always did. but i stink more. yes.

pretty tired now.. i wonder if anything good's on TV now? nothing but that "abtronic" infomercial. hahhaa.. abs without work? how nice.
