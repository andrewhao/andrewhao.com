what can i say? i survived.

woke up a lil earlier than i expected to today.. had to go to a hospital lab to get blood samples taken from my inner elbow (so they can screen me for.. hearing problems. hm.). i was expecting a little more from waiting 30 minutes in the waiting room than "Andrew Hao? sit down here.. open your arm.. " (poke) (few eternities later) "okay you can leave" haha.. i couldnt look down at my arm. i ahve a bad aversion to blood.

clarinet sectionals today.. we were supposed to be indoors and in the band room and playing. well.. one out of three. cuz apparently doc or mandac forgot to open the bandroom so we had to make do playing outside where the wind blew music all over the place. oh well.. it ended up decently well.

at cia tonight we had a lil heated game of jeopardy haha.. guys vs girls. and i must say.. we men have quite a competitive attitude. which would explain our astounding resounding victory. nice nice..

gonna go watch CCIC's open team play some bball tomo at the Chinese Olympics @ CHS.. haha i'll sub in for somebody.. i'll just stand there and draw fouls.
