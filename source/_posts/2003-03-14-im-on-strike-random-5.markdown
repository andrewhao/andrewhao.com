**So You've Decided to Be Evil:**
[http://www.darksites.com/souls/horror/evilguide/](http://www.darksites.com/souls/horror/evilguide/)

funny site, but speaking of evil, i'm knee deep in it.

the evils of last minute essay writing.
the evils of last minute calc homeworking.
the evils of contacts that won't let you see straight.
the evils of noisy siblings.
the evils of AIM and Xanga (i have found the solution though!)
the evils of really fatty blisters on your foot.
the evils of really spicy ramen noodles that you didnt expect to be so spicy and are probably giving you heartburn and acid reflux and whatever you wanna get.

anyways that sums up my night.. and probably the rest of this morning as well. good night, good luck to all other junior sufferers, and oh..

i'm going to boycott school for a while.

..that's the plan.
