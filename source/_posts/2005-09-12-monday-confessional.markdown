I'm wondering what's wrong with me, with regards to my (in-)action or (in-)ability to be moved by the pictures of devastation and wiltering people-bodies. And for the third or fourth time this summer I'm dealing with the question: where does compassion come from? Why can't my stupid selfish self _feel_ some more? Why do TV images not affect me as much as I'd like them to? And then again, is compassion a feeling? Or something else. Either way, I need more of it.

I've been realizing lately that I've been wearing my major(s) like some medallion I can brag about. What major are you again? Ooooooh. Ahh. A double? Wow. And more and more I'm wondering whether why I'm doing this, more for the glory and praise it's gonna get me or because I __________? Your guess is as good as mine.

But not all things are as bad as you think they are. For example, my roomies and I are figuring out, slowly and surely, how to cook (kind of). Nothing's caught on fire yet, although numerous vegetables have met moldy fates in the crisper. And dishes, oh dishes, a problem never eradicated.

I need to take my faith more seriously. As in, my Christian lifestyle is very wishy-washy. I'm still being babied and spoon-fed and I need to start asking harder questions, process the Word at a deeper level, maybe even start doubting a little more. I think a very real fear I've had lately is whether investigating deeper would unearth new doubts about my faith. Would I be willing to take them head-on, submit them to my community, and struggle with them? Nah, I would rather let the deeper thinkers do the struggling and not spend that time confronting the deeper fears and issues that are buried back there.

And yet at the same time, I know that a part of me can't get it all satisfied at the intellectual level. Like this "figuring-God-out" business would get me to a certain level, but it could never take me all the way. Then I'd be totally discounting faith for what it is. That's what I found on Saturday. Last Saturday I heard something I needed to hear.

I don't really listen to people. I nod and, while the conversation ensues, basically ask airheaded lamebrained and canned responses. CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY, YOU FOOL.

I never needed a Palm organizer until this year. And if I ever lost that thing, I would be in a deep hole. What does that say about me?

I am busy, very school-busy. I am stressed, a little bit people-stressed. I am tired, a bit emotionally-tired. Not to mention ramble-prone.

I am starting to like alt-punk emo (even though it all sounds the same). World ends, pigs fly tomorrow.

I act like I need to present a perfect, Teflon, Christian Person(tm) facade to people when I talk to them. Like I'll try to do nice things and try to say nice things and try to think nice things (all that _trying_, if you haven't guessed by now, drives you bloody crazy) And part of what I heard on Saturday was that my brokenness and messedupness and value (despite all that) to God speaks more volumes than any front I could put on.
