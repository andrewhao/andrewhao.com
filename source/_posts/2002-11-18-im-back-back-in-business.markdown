went to school today totally groggy cuz i spent all of last night working on the computer(s). good news is that it's all finally upgraded.. bad news is that i've jacked something up in the process but OH WELL.

so fast (really really drools). sorry. geek moment right there.

you know what i learned today? wf ends up being really really expensive. not to sound cheap and all (actually i probably always do) but whew.. my dad did the math (and when he does the math, it's a bad thing =D) and he was speechless for a moment or two hahahaha.. oh well. i hope it's worth it? who knows if i'll actually go. but jack and vinny and others from church are going.. so i guess i should try to go. hope so.

didnt do any hw today.. got home, played some guitar and went to sleep. aiyah. work now.
