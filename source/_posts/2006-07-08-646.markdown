I'm not the initiator type (I wish I was). You won't find me calling people up very often, or planning events or whatnot. I used to assume I was just too busy at that given moment to do such things. But now I have free weekends, I find myself just puttering around the apartment, perfectly happy to be alone in my bubble.  
  
I know this isn't a bad thing; it's somewhat linked into my personality and who I am. And it's somewhat of a good time for introspection, reflection and meditation. And maybe I'm really just recovering from the 24/7-people-presence of last semester. But it's somewhat lonely, and I realize that I'm more of a withdrawn personality than I would like to admit.  
  
My roommate called me from SD last night to catch up. "You're in your apartment alone on a Friday night?" he playfully chided. I was happy he called; that phone call meant a lot. Why don't I do these things?  
  
This is humbling: the realization I'm another passive-aggressive Asian American male. It comes out in the summer. I'm working on it. Man, summer life is an interesting paradox.  
  
(I realize that Xanga is not the best place to air out personal issues. But heck, I'd like to be transparent with   
you and I. Humbling introspection? Check.)
