i think a big part of summer is self control. like you've got the power to crash and burn if you're not careful (cuz you've got all the free time in the world, at least till august).

i dont know what you're thinking, but this really has been dogging me. i mean, there's nobody around to impress, so why should I take a shower every day (okay bad example, but a real dilemma) or perhaps there's a box of chocolates out on the table, what's stopping me from eating every single one whenever i feel like it?

feels like summer's given me a license to do anything I want, whenever I want cuz i feel like it. and sure, it feels good in the beginning but soon i'm gonna end up paying for it. i feel like i'm losing a lot of the discipline i thought i had doing the things i know i need to be doing. like running, or like spending time with a Creator that longs to be with me. but i'm too busy puttering around the house doing what feels good or avoiding what doesn't. and you know what?

**june 22, 2004.** i'm tired of it.
