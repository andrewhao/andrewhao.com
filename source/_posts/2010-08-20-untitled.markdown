I have discovered you cannot properly grieve in a city; it won't give you a damn second to be alone. I'd like to have a moment of silence in an alleyway, behind the dumpster, over the beggar-man, to the cacophony of car horns and ice cream carousel jingles. No dice. The city clamors, roars, and cries for attention.

Once I sat in Oakland traffic and watched low-slung motorbikes and Cadillacs rush by in hip-hop time, their mourner-passengers leaning out windows and moonroofs, flailing their arms and cursing out the world. Because when the city pays you no attention, you must raise your voice and roar.

Maybe I'll hold the wake behind the stadium, or under the piers, or by the train tracks. It'd never work though. The guests would get lost in the crowds, bumping shoulders with cruise ship passengers. What could they hear over the roar of the fans, or the earthshaking rumble of the 252? Tourists would train their cameras, passersbys would gawk, it'd be a spectacle.

So that's why when funeral processions snake through Chinatown, they are accompanied by a band. Because when the city drowns you out, you must raise the horn and wail.
