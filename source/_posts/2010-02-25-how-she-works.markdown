One point of friction between myself and Sarah is that we have a really, really hard time communicating. I mean, it doesn't help that women are elaborate enigmas, and as men we are Astonishingly Dense. Gentlemen, tell me if you've ever heard the following from your ladies:

_You just don't get me._

_I wanted you to listen and feel with me._

_Stop giving me solutions and just listen to me._

_Why are you so quiet?_

_No, that's not what I meant._

_Are you listening to me?_

_I want you to want to._

_I don't have to tell you; you should just know it already._

**WELL,**

Sarah just gave me the Best Valentine's Gift Ever:

Sarah made me an instruction manual for Valentine's Day. No, seriously. It's a cute handcrafted book with little snippets of lists of her likes and dislikes, her basic info, and most of all, this mental model and decision diagram of the female brain (well, hers at least).

My logical, rational, Engineer mind rejoices. I love this girl.
