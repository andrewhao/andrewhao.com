I was at Haste House prayer this morning and in the middle some folks started crying for the broken and lost and oppressed of the world. Half-sobs, salt-blister tears and only what can be described as cries to a One who promised to be powerful and mighty and just. I wrote them down (I hope they don't mind) because they were frightening, they were foreign and so beautifully and earnestly not-about-themselves (I know there's the perfect word for this floating around out there).

They were weeping because they had _been there_, watched kids cling to their legs, witnessed unjust factory conditions, heard village women whisper stories of genocide, read statistics about the 6000 kids contracting malaria daily, a continent dying of AIDS, a single man loitering by People's Park or huddled under the pillar of the Unit 3 parking garage.

Is the burden too much for their God, is their God doing nothing? Their hearts hunger to be broken again and again like His is.

I wrote down their prayers and tried to mouth them myself. They trickle out of my throat but never make it to my heart. Man, I still don't know what it means to have my heart break for anything. It's a tricky little guilty feeling, I decide, and tell God to do it anyways, break my heart unequivocally for something or someone other than myself.

At that moment all I know is this pounding desire to know God's heart so much to be weeping His salty tears on a Saturday morning.
