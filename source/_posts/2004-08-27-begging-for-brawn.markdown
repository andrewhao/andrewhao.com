if there is one thing i may say, i must say that working out at the RSF is humbling. while the he-men next to me are pumping 200-easy pounds i'm just trying to lift the bars and doing wimp curls and everything. eesh. you can have all the brains and the riches and popularity in the world but in the weight room it's all back to the survival of the fittest (or rippest.. is that a word?)

berkeley gives frosh rhapsody online music for 2 bucks a month. what that means is unlimited streaming of crazy songs. time to listen to, well, just about everything. i heart, i heart.

i'm not sure how to feel about team USA basketball -- embarrassment, indignation or just pity? welcome to the big leagues, USA. ouch.
