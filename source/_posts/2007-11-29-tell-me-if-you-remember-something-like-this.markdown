Think back to third grade or so. Remember those days when a kid would barf in class? He or she'd turn all sickly pale, look down at the ground and hurl. Then all the kids around him would groan and hold their noses while shuffling outside as the janitor would come in donned in rubber gloves, sprinkling Comet all over the stained carpet. Wasn't it great? We'd get five or ten minutes outside while we waited for the air to clear and the carpet to dry (and the sick kid to call his mom).

Come on, tell me you remember. Weren't those days the best?

I don't know why I thought of this today, but I got a good long chuckle out of it. No, I was never the kid barfing (but let me tell you, I'd come real close on several occasions).
