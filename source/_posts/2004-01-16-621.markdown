my website is down, so xanga shall be used (as it probably shoulda been all the while)...  
  
but what is there to say? i've been scrabbling around pretty anxiously for the past week, and happily i think the spin cycle is dying down. here are the casualties of the past week:  
  
a) my body (i'm all conditioned for college now)  
b) my friends (where's Andrew?)  
c) my lips (lynbrook clarinets play till they bleed, baby)  
d) my planner (lost.. somewhere..)  
e) my brain (what's the professor been talking about.. for the last half hour?)  
e) and finally, traces of sanity.. but happily, i didnt need that much anyways.  
  
i think it's good, i'm satisfied. read a couple of books yesterday that were really inspirational. thanks God, you satisfy _me_.
