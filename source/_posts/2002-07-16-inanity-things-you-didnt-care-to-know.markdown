the dishwasher's full. and that means we resort to using the small bowls. which is bad, because they cant hold all that much food. so everytime i poke at the chicken on my noodles, something falls out of the bowl onto the table/my lap. which is a really tedious way of eating.

calc hw was a pain today.. you see, the problem with calc isn't the concept part - the problem with calc is doing the problem itself. if you get lost somewhere in the middle of a problem, you're screwed. you'd be surprised - it's the simple stuff that trips you up the most. somewhere, amidst the definite integrals, derivatives, antiderivatives, integration by parts and integration by substitution i'm supposed to get an ANSWER? and they always happen to turn out wrong too.

wheel installation kit comes in the mail tomorrow, and i guess my dad and i'll get to work on the installation. this should be cool..

i got completely ripped today at piano class. as usual. sigh.. either i'm piano-disabled or i dont try enough. and i'd like to think that i naturally suck (cuz that'd give me an excuse).. but i really should be practicing a lot more. humph..
