ap english was not nearly as bad as i thought, but then again those are famous last words. vertigo "final" was pretty darn awesome.. hahaha mr. hanford. how come all the good stuff happens to him? oh man my hero.. he was reading some of his nonfiction work about his high school days. so fun.. he must've been one cool kid back in his year.

tux pickups.. jameson alex chris and i had some fun heading down to blossom hill eli whitney, eating at costco and rapping on the way up. goodness alex choy can bust some flows, who would have known?

off to beatrice's for study group session.. that went about five hours. GAH her parents needed to do the asian parent thing. that is.. serve us dinner, snack food, aw man  :!:  i always feel bad when a parent does it, but it's standard protocol and no matter how much i try to argue in broken chinese, it doesnt work. man, beatrice you must thank your parents for us. anyways pretty intense study session, awesome =)

awright, i'm up at 5AM right now with about six chapters to skim through. noooo problem =) formal is tonight! awesome.. if i don't sleep through it first haahahha.
