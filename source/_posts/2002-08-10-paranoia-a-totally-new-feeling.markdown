oh man.. i lost my backpack, wallet and keys today. sigh.. how depressing. whoever out there has em now has my address, house keys, car keys and my driver's license. guys.. always keep watch over your stuff. especially the important stuff. aiyah..

my youth group and i were helping out at cityteam (volunteer organization in downtownish SJ) at a carnival sort of thing. i left my backpack behind an astrojump cuz i was "supervising" there. i didnt really think about it.. i mean.. who would steal my backpack? i dont have a habit of being vigilant over my belongings cuz we all dont exactly live in a crime-ridden area (now if this were NY or something.. that'd be different heh).. yeah. so right when we left i kinda noticed that.. it wasnt THERE any more.

uh to make a long story short, we may need to change the lock on our front door.. im gonna need to start parking in the garage. it's funny.. i made a series of decisions that lead to this situation today. i could've taken my lone car key instead of the keychain with the house keys as well. i didnt need to bring my wallet.

ergh.. well.. i guess it could've been worse. you know how they say "trust in God.. but lock your car". how true =P but seriously.. please be praying for protection over our house.. that  whoever took it have the heart to return it. but hey.. all my stuff isnt really mine.. if God gave it to me, then i guess i cant really complain huh?

i gotta think about that. i learned my lesson today.. maybe for a lifetime.

life wouldn't suck so bad if all our learning didn't come from our mistakes.
