last night i dreamed about falling asleep on the couch next to the computer, leaving AIM on and an unfinished image edit open on the computer.

this morning i woke up, sprawled on the couch next to the computer. AIM was left open and my unfinished work stared back at my bleary eyes.

yep. sounds like normal.

my first community service activity with key club this year was today. it's been so long since i've helped out and it felt good again to be doing something useful.

working on the agape sweatshirt/long sleeve t-shirt design.. it's going to be interesting to see how we're going to incorporate two designs from two different people onto a single shirt.. i hope this works out.

i've been eating out so often lately.. man i feel so bad pigging out and everyting. my body's really starting to show it too. and my shin's not getting any better so i can't run. i'm gonna die of high cholesterol at 21 years old.

anyways.. i'm setting myself up for a busy weekend. thanks for reading.
