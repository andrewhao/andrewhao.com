What happens to a dream deferred?





Does it dry up
  
like a raisin in the sun?
  
Or fester like a sore--
  
And then run?
  
Does it stink like rotten meat?
  
Or crust and sugar over--
  
like a syrupy sweet?





Maybe it just sags
  
like a heavy load.





Or does it explode?

  


A Dream Deferred by Langston Hughes
