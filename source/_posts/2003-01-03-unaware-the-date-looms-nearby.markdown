there is exactly **one** googlism for **"andrew hao"**: _andrew hao is a fast smooth talker_

nice. i think.

anyways yesterday was pretty cool.. woke up at 8AM without an alarm (cuz i conked out so early from the night before). attempted to do some hw but failed miserably.

had some more worship practice with the team.. i think i'm getting a bit more used to the e-drums (synthesizer drums) as time goes by. i still get pretty lost when i try to do some fills.. hahaha i'm no rock star.

went skating with key club last night.. pretty fun stuff. not having skated for a full year, you can bet i was pretty wobbly for the first fifteen minutes or so. very wobbly. but yeah.. great times playing ice football (tackles and all).. watching christine su 2039423 times all over the ice (i.e. ON the ice). made some cider chocolate, which turned out too hot and too concentrated and earned some very strange stares.

**random thought: **since when was key club like.. 100% asian? where did everyone else go? is this a bad thing?

anyways.. got some math hw to finish up.. chem packet to attempt to (but will never) succeed in figuring out. jan 6th - why must thy coming be so soon?
