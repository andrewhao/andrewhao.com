#### Identity crises


I'm at a CS review session, and the three folks sitting in seats in front of me have their laptops out. One guy pulls out his Mac, the other two have PC laptops. Every one of them is running Linux. (Hint: Linux users get geek cred among their peers--it's what all the cool kids do).

Hear that? That's the sound of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates crying.


#### Guilty pleasures


I'm walking through Sproul Plaza and the guy in front of me gets stopped by this Flyering Guy for a campus event.

"Interested in a campus Super Smash Brothers tournament?" Flyering Guy asks.

The guy in front of me tries to act like he's not interested, but his body language gives it away and he stutter-steps. After a moment's hesitation, he snatches a flyer from Flyering Guy with a sheepish grin.

Flyering Guy lets out a long, loud chuckle. "Melee," he yells after Sheepish Guy, "Melee."
