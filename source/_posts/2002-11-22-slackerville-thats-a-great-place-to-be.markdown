aye.. i'm slacking so much these days. now i have like way too much free time and i kind of sit and home in front of the computer and do.. dumb stuff. really really dumb stuff. take for example, the **[FAKE XANGA](http://xanga.com/gsgnine)** that i wasted an hour on. spent another half hour trying to figure out the fax machine to fax something to a friend, wasted an additional 20 minutes checking everybody's profiles.

i told tammy that i'd do my calc hw right now. whoops. uh.. i'll get going again.
