this week's been one of the most intense that i've been through, both emotionally as well as academically.

but i'm (mostly) still here by the grace of God..

thank goodness i canceled SATIIs.. they would have killed me tomorrow. but if any of you guys are taking em tomorrow, i wish you the best of luck (esp to garrick and the others who're going up to oakland to hang with the gangstas  8) )

today basically consisted of yearbook signing.. my hands are starting to grow numb from all those pages :D it's a nostalgic feeling, writing in yearbooks of people you're most likely not going to see again and wondering what you could write that would be both sentimental and witty at the same time. will i be remembered in 10 years' time? 5 years? i'm not so sure about that.. but i guess that's how life is  ;)

check these dudes out: **burning tree projekt**
these guys are sweet.. started by enik lin (the guy with the tall spikes).. joined by guitarists tim sohn and sean gordon, bassist david kim, drummer david chaing and emcee andre harris.. they make up southern cali's **burning tree projekt**

i guess you could call it a sort of a Linkin Park / Puddle of Mudd / Wu Tang kind of a blend of fusion rock.. only with lyrics focused on God and their lives through Him.. on the christian music front i'd say they're pretty close to the Blindside sound.

i've got a feeling these guys have got a lot working for em.. their self-titled first EP out in a few weeks. check em out: [www.burningtreeprojekt.com](http://www.burningtreeprojekt.com)

sometimes i'd find bands in magazines or by word of mouth but you know what's ironic? accidentally came across these guys on xanga. what a small world..
