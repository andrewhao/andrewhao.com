i hate it when i waste hours surfing the net and reading up on the lives of the incredibly rich and (sorta) famous teens. you know who i'm talking about, the teens that drive fast convertibles, attend parties with good looking people, live in big estates in sunny climes and wear the latest clothing.

it's a vicarious experience i guess, finding myself trying to stick myself in their shoes and wishing that hey, perhaps that could have been me.

i hate it cuz i find out what more other people have, then start believing that what is perfectly enough for me, isn't.

--------------------------------------------------

on a separate note, break's about to begin and i really want to spend it getting to know people that i've lost track of.

on a related tangent, i've strung up tons of committments for myself, i hope i can keep them (i have a strange way of not doing so).

i'm just thinking back on old times and feeling a little embarrassed at myself. i was one pretty arrogant kiddo back in the day.. maybe even really recently. it's a little scary, but i bet all of us were like that sometime or another. or maybe it's just me.

diced onions and chicken,
