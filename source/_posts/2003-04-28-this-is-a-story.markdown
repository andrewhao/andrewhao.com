break's gone, my freedom's gone, and hello, who are you?

say hello to my friends, _stress, pitifulness_ and _mister just-too-darn-much_. they'll be overstaying their welcome for this month of may and a bit of june.

unfortunately they (as well as i) have all caught a case of the _lazies_ which will cause _dr. dad_ to bust out with the painful double-dose of remedies known as _advice_ and _when i was your age_

and this probably borders on one of the weirdest things i've ever written.
but to make things short.. break's over, welcome to reality kid.
