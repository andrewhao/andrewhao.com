well tis another new year.. and that always means new resolutions to make and new resolutions to break =P and as always, G9 will come out with his annual list of resolutions. i know that i've really slacked off on last year's resolutions, but i really want this year to be different. if you havent fallen asleep yet, **read on...**

**IN 2003, I RESOLVE TO:**
**1. be genuine**: it's sad when you go to school and see so many phony people walking around.. so many people who put on a facade and pretend they're this or that for some motive or another. i admit i've been like that.. but i wanna discover who i am and stay true to that.

**2. keep my body in decent shape**: i take a look at my body right now and it's... sad, really  :(  a mere three months after cross country ends and my body has regressed to a worse state than ever. i need to start building up a habit of staying in shape, doing workouts and the such otherwise i'll someday regret it.

yeah, if dying of high cholestrol at age 20 cuz of mcdonalds meals a few thousand too many times sounds great to you.. then it sounds great to me.

**3. be crazy for christ**: i wanna live a life that totally reflects what God's doing in mine. so many times i've been so hypocritical.. been so ashamed.. been so afraid. i want to experience God on a regular basis.. not just the occasional so-called spiritual high, but live out a crazy love for a God who's done so much for us.

**4. strengthen friendships**: i know a lot of my friendships are at superficial levels.. and to those of you that feel like our relationship is that way - i'd like to let you know that i wanna get to know you guys better. i've let many people slip away from me.. and i think another thing i need to learn is to let go sometimes as well.

**5. self discipline**: three words: STOP WASTING TIME, STUPID. okay, four.
