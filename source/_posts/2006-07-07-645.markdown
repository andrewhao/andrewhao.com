Strange: I've had to seriously consider (after working overtime the past week or so), "if I had a wife and kids at home, would I be home or would I be here?" Of course, the implications of this should probably not be read too far into, but nonetheless.  
  
What's scary is not only the fact that I have to face it, but that I realized I would have trouble peeling myself away from my work. Man, this is not boding well. I think I'm a little too driven at times and the lines are too blurry between work and, well, everything else that's important. And I can already see how it could hurt people I love.  
  
In short, it's not healthy and I need to start setting boundaries for myself. Stay balanced, focused, and healthy.  
  
Overheard:

Man, I'm so strong even my muscles have muscles.
