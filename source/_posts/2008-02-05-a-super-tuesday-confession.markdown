Is it so wrong to want to vote for Obama because you like his rhetoric?  Because you find him likable, gosh darn it. I agree (mostly) with his domestic platform, (mostly) on foreign policy, a little less on the so-called "moral" issues. But the guy seems like a level-headed leader I'd like to call President.

Heh, there's only so much I have to say here (I've been pretty mum about my political leanings, mostly because I haven't had any for the longest time). I guess I'm trying to explain this sense of excitement and even gratitude in an admittedly-imperfect political system that I can take part in. And I'm trying to disentangle the mess of strident voices in my head telling me: I'm wrong, I'm ignorant, I haven't prayed, I haven't understood these implications _fully_.

When will I _fully_ grasp what's at stake? There's only so much you can know about a candidate, right? You have to pray you've seen past the hype, peered into the issues and stood by your convictions. After a while, in good faith and conscience, you have to vote going on what (little) you know.

So I researched, I prayed, and today I voted. I hope you do the same.
