we'd sit in the darkened and strangely cool room, just the three of us. Mister would lay back, fully slouched and feet propped on an adjacent chair and lazily fire staple gun rounds into the cardboard plane with eyes half open. Albert and I would take a glance at each other, and wonder what in the world we had gotten ourselves into.

it's a well known fact that asian moms want their kids to get the best education possible. so ten years ago when albert's mom hooked up with my mom into this brilliant plan to increase their kid's verbal skills by signing us up for some private writing tutoring, their logic could be understood and forgiven.

problem was, the writing class didn't involve much writing. i remember the first time walking into the storefront studio and being greeted by whitewashed walls with books hung every four feet or so along the walls and a lanky, caucasian man leaning back in one of the few mahogany chairs arranged throughout the room. i can't remember his name, so now i call him Mister.

Albert and I were surprised by Mister's laid back attitude towards, well, everything. and he was always leaning back, far back, propped up against the thick wooden table and staring a little bit into the distance. heck, albert and i were just two scared third graders and feeling slightly intimidated by Mister.

Mister had a wife named Peggy. she came in once in awhile to tend to business matters. she was Vietnamese by appearance and was strong spoken, particularly when Mister would call out to her and tell her to "get me some water" or berate her, asking "why can't you do this better?" i don't even know what they fought about, only that it always came out of nowhere in the middle of the lesson.

I don't remember learning much in those lessons. in fact, i'm finding it hard to recall what exactly we did, asides from learning the definition of "abridged", writing a report about grasshoppers and building that airplane.

i never did write that report on grasshoppers, but we sure did build the airplane. I'm not certain how writing and building a 1:5 scale prop airplane exactly connected, but one day Mister got the idea, eyes gleaming, that we were to build this airplane. we listened in rapt attention as he detailed how all we needed to do was get a lawnmower engine, carve out some wood and we were good to go.

so in the next three weeks, writing was eschewed in exchange for working with a saw and cruising various parking lots and dump sites for unwanted wood. he would literally take us in his beat-up 1970's Oldsmobile (the driver's-side door wouldn't open, he had to climb through the side window) and we'd cruise various high-tech company lots, looking for wood. and when we did, we strapped it to the roof of the Olds and carry it home triumphantly.

as the plane came more and more together (it was basically a long wooden box) Mister would talk his plane more ferverently. i kept wondering why we were doing this (he had neglected to tell us) but shut up, because adults knew best. Mister knew that this plane needed to be finished, and fast.

that week, my mom pulled me from the writing workshops. so i was kind of bummed not being able to see the fully assembled plane, but kind of glad cuz Mister kinda weirded me out. albert later told me how they entered the plane in some Mercury News contest, complete with rotating lawnmower engine propellors and wooden props. but neither of us actually learned anything.

well, there was supposed to be a moral in the story but i'm not sure if there is one anymore. people are people, some are stranger than others and some will charge you 30 bucks every week to get you to build an airplane with them.
