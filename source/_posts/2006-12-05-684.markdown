It's been awhile since I've felt the way I did this morning.  
  
I
was talking to a good friend last week about how it's so easy to be
discouraged in our failures and how we read about being "freed from
sin" but still at times, feel soundly enslaved. We wanna be transformed
by you, Jesus, but dang it's no easy road.  
  
And I'm glad the
prayer team's been talking about grace -- how little we understand
about it, how much fuller and amazing it is if we'd stop and fully
understand how, or more importantly, why
it was given to us. And how beautiful it is that "where sin increased,
grace increased all the more..." I can't figure it out, Jesus.  
  
It's
weird, because that's how You're breaking my addictions. Where I wanna
run and hide all my pockmarks, blemishes and moral failures away in my
closet, your light exposes it and your freakin' bountiful Grace covers
it. And when your Light shines, everything is revealed for what it
really is.  

  

It's been awhile since I've felt the way I did this
morning--disappointed by how my habitual sin no longer satisfied the
way it used to. And realizing, yeah, God, you're releasing the chains.
You're setting me free.  
  
My CS group was eating together last
night and the topic came across our ethnic names. Nobody's asked me
this for years, and I had almost forgotten. My Chinese name (![](http://www.mandarintools.com/cgi-bin/ugif/6069.gif)![](http://www.mandarintools.com/cgi-bin/ugif/5149.gif)) means
"grace" and "light". Man, that hits me hard.   

  

from a romans book:  

  

You see, at just the right time, when
we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will
anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might
possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this:
While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  

  

...where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so that, just as
sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness
to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
