i'm standing in the shower, off balance (quite dangerous, especially in the shower) and fighting the ten pound lead weights on my eyelids. The Inner Guy speaks his (perfectly-timed) words of wisdom:

"..." (snore)

no, folks. 7AM is no time for anything at all.

the scholarly life here is more draining than i thought it would be. classes are going to put on the big hurt, especially with a couple of profs that seem to believe the more work piled on, the merrier. couple that with my overestimation of my abilities, and you have a recipe for disaster, forthcoming in a month (at least).

but no pity, i've gotta work hard but even more importantly keep my priorities straight.

thank you all the CCIC and Lynbrook people who came up to check up on us, it was fun seeing yall again =) irvine, cal poly people you guys will love it when you get down there.

i've been to five or six fellowships here and my goodness, the groups, the worship, the speakers, the people, they're all so awesome. quite encouraging and also quite hard to make a decision.

the facebook is a time sucker. die, die, die.

i'm learning (the hard way) that you can't manufacture a character, a personality. why in the world is it so hard to be genuine?

God, I want to know the way Your heart breaks for my dorm, my floor, my roommate and my campus.

and things are getting tough,
it's a foreign land, please never leave.
