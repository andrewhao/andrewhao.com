ran today at paly. sucked a grip. i'm back to frosh year speed. question to myself: is this a psychological barrier i can't beat?

i won't let this get to me. can't mope around about it. gonna keep a good attitude and work like a monster this season. LISTEN TO ME, ANDREW.

i'm going to make vague goals for myself every two weeks of the season. this week: "you are a distance runner. make the pain your friend." mind over matter. mind over matter. shuddup already  ;)
