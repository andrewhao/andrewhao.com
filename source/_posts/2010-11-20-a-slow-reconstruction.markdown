The longer I spend around a church, the more I see that people are really, really broken. And that's really good for me to see, because I'm starting to grasp how deep the Father-love really is, and how unconditional it is. Loud are the songs of broken sinners.

Henri Nouwen is teaching me to stare loneliness in the face and accept it, to allow it to teach me to "live rather than just survive" and direct me to the Father. It's hard, because I have problems trusting that I will be unconditionally loved in a human way. Can I believe that?

It occurred to me last Sunday that communion is the one place where Father-love is tangible. The memory of the cross becomes tactile in the bread and the wine.
