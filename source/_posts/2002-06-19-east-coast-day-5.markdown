so we spent the better part of today traveling to New York. same ol same ol: drive, sleep, get a numb butt. drive, sleep, get a numb butt. repeat for 6 hours. no problem...

after a good part of 2 hours spent in the backseat of a van wandering the streets of new york, i've made several (badly based) conclusions:

**1. we're not in san jose anymore:** okay, this is obvious. i'd say that the majority of the population i could see was african american (to be politically correct), a good two-thirds of that were teen males decked out in "thug gear".. if you know what i mean.

**2. the car is a status symbol** if you'll notice, the more affluent men prefer big, expensive SUVs rolling on "dubz". that is, it's either a navigator, expedition or escalade propped up on huge gleaming rims. for those who can't afford to cough up 50-ish grand, the import culture is beginning to pop up here too. i noticed a good number of riced up (or at least that was the intent) japanese sport compacts cruising this city. i also noticed that there were no asians around to drive them haha..

i have one question: if you care so much about your car and spend so much time and money on it, why live in new york? hahaha... the mean streets of this city are no place for your nice car.

**3. cough cough cough. cough some more.** smog galore. is that the sun i see? can't be..

**4. nobody cares about your personal space** privacy? what's that? everybody's too busy going somewhere or whatnot.. blaring ultra-loud music from their car whether you like it or not. new york is busy and loud.

i keep running those horror stories of new york through my mind every time i step out into the hotel lobby... haha i guess the media blows a lot of it up. but hey, i cant be too careful..
