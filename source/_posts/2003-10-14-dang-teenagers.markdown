this entry will be titled "Dang Teenagers" or "How I, Andrew Hao, 17, Tangled With Law Enforcement."

so it's saturday morning, 8:15ish which is about 15 minutes too late according to my SAT registration sheet and i'm aimlessly taking left and right turns in an unfamiliar area of East San Jose, trying to figure out just where the heck Yerba Buena high school is (obviously not down this street and, whoops, not that one either). for about six blocks now all i can see are apartment complexes and retirement homes, obviously signs of middle class suburbanized America. well whoopee, turns out that i've passed my street a grand total of 3 times before i realize i was supposed to turn.

so, grumbling a little to myself and getting a little restless cuz it was now 8:20 and the test takers at Yerba Buena would be grumbling about a certain tardy Andrew Hao #9485132, i pull into the left turn lane (a little too fast, i must confess) and impatiently wait for the light to turn green.

now this street is especially strange, being that it has a fatty divider running up and down the middle of it to separate lanes and flow of traffic. i, in my SAT-inspired delirium, do not notice the divider and take a hard left turn.

what i **do** notice are certain arrows pointing the direction of traffic in the lanes - and they weren't in my direction. **ohhh crud.**

and - what a wonderful coincidence! - what i also notice is a certain motorcycle slowly approaching me 20 feet away. and in another stroke of coincidence, the sides of the motorcycle happen to read "SJPD" in big black bold lettering.

now as of right now i am confused. the green light told me i could turn left. the white arrows tell me i'm about to create a major accident with oncoming traffic. the police officer is at my window.

i roll down the window and in the most innocent voice i could muster, ask the cop "is this a one way street?"

he doesnt answer, but gives me the strangest glare this side of the bay area.

i try again. "i was turning left at that intersection and i got onto this street.. is this a one way street?" if i could blink my eyelashes a la _bambi_, i would.

"what do you mean is this a one-way street?" he interrupts. he scans me, a skinny asian kid in an Agape sweatshirt and about to pee in his pants. "have you had any alcohol?" he gives me the hardest glare. i shrink. or at least i feel like i do.

"nonoononoononoo officer, i just turned and.." before i can finish the sentence i look over and notice the **correct** street i was supposed to be on, on the **other** side of the divider. ohhcrud. i dont even bother finishing the sentence.

"have you had any drugs in the past twenty four hours?"

"n-n-n-nno! it was an honest mistake, really!"

he rolls his eyes. "do you have a license? well learn to drive!"

that's a good sign. yes, criticize my driving, but don't think i'm a druggie.

"you know that this is a misdemeanor right?"

chills up and down my spine. ohhhkay, i may have some explaining to do to my parents after i'm locked up in county jail. yes i can see it now, "Teen Incarcerated For Driving Wrong Way, World Disappointed"

let's make a long story short. i fumbled and bumbled for words that wouldnt come out but Officer Authority must've seen my SAT panic and felt pity. or contempt. "dang teenagers these days" he must've thought. "can't drive for anything worth shaking a stick at" i found yerba buena (it was behind a whole line of barbed wire, steel-caged fences) and promptly bombed the test, but that's okay. i wasn't in jail!

yes, andrew hao has had his first encounter with law enforcement and he hopes its his last.
