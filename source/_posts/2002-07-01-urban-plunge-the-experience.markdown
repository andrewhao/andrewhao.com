**6/29/02 - Harbor House, Oakland**

these last 3 days here have really been an eye-opening experience for me. we've been through so much, from diversity training to community service to cooking our own food (hehe) to just being able to totally bond as a group.

Diversity training was basically where some Harbor House staff and a few other outside consultants or so discussed a lot of diversity-related issues w/ us. we went over all sorts of topics, from our own racial backgrounds, environments and discussing culture in general. Harbor House has a philosophy of "sharing stories" to overcome racial boundaries (i.e. through a sharing of our own personal experiences, we'll let the other group see our points of view and this will change our own views, outlooks and prejudices. hahaha.. Yii-Shyun (CCIC NV counselor) seemed to have a minor problem with that =P

what i felt was interesting about this training was that not all of the staff was christian: Neriah was of Egyptian descent and she was raised Muslim, while Jerry believed in a myriad of things, a combination of Christianity, Buddhism and Daoism. Neriah seemed to be sort of frustrated in how we seemed to her to be reluctant to do a total diversifying revolution in the church. heh yeah.. we had a lot of discussion about that, and personally we felt that we need to take small small steps before we take the larger ones. it was kind of interesting to see the other viewpoints of Neriah and Jerry.. they wanted to achieve racial diversity and reconciliation through these complicated step-methods and all that.. a really complicated process.. yeah.. and we felt that it kinda ignored the fact that the power and love of God plays a huge role in this area - a totally important aspect of it. i mean, without God being there to change hearts and attitudes, we as humans can only do so much.

Carol, former superintendent of schools of Oakland encouraged us to do something to bring social justice into the realm of our churches, youth groups and all that. a lot of great ideas came through in that session.

our group has totally bonded since we got here. we're made up of 10 ppl - me, Wes, David, Robert, Ambrose, Kevin, Myra, Christine, Ann and Yii-Shyun. we had a _lot_ of really great, deep discussions ranging from spiritual issues, diversity in our church, racism to girls, relationships and other really silly and pointless stuff =D honestly i dont think i've felt this open before; i've never had such frank, deep convos before and i think that's the level i gotta be at when communicating with the Christ family.. that's being genuine. that's keepin it real =P

cooking: ohyeah, this was fun. we all got a combined $90 to feed 10 people for 4 days. impossible? think again! haha we had a lot of fun shopping and looking for bargains (buy 1 get one free! wahoo!) great time though.. i learned a lot too (haha although i got relegated to the minor cooking roles: stirring the pot, washing dishes lol). our eating's not too shabby either. we've had hot dogs, fries, tater tots, spaghetti, chicken noodle soup and other awesome stuff. better than i initially expected =P

we had to go to berkeley twice for 2 projects: one was to survey the people there and to find their views on spirituality and God; the other was to talk to, interact and buy food for a homeless person on the street.

so the first day, me and Wes go out and talk to people. problem is, only **I** ended up doing the talking. cuz according to wes, i picked the craziest, wackiest people to talk to. now that i think about it, they were pretty.. _different_: 2 homeless guys (one i gave 50cents to), an animal rights activist (supported PETA, very interesting to talk to and she gave me a ton of pamphlets lol).. she was into mysticism and all that. but what REALLY was the highlight of the day was the tarot card reader.. he was sitting on a street corner and smoking a cigarette. his sign read: "Tarot Reading: $10" i approached him and sort of began my survey.. lol.. it went like this:

**me: **"um sir, i'm doing this sort of survey on spirituality and i'd like to ask you a few brief questions.."

**him: **"its too tough to explain briefly."

**me: **"um sir, well could you elaborate a lil?"

**him: **"well if you wanna pay 10 bucks..."

**me: **"well i was hoping for something really brief, really general.. if you could please.."

**him: **"hey look, it's a very _complex, mystical _thing. if you want the explanation, i'll need 10 bucks"

**me: **(move on to next question)

**him: **"10 bucks"

**me: **"um.. well thanks for your time anyways sir.."

(wes and i walk away as quickly as we can)

LOL.. wow.. we cracked up over this so much later on.. yeah. shoulda videotaped that or something.. hahhaha

on the second trip (meeting homeless ppl) was a bit tougher to meet a homeless person. i'd found myself automatically blowing some beggars off, then 3 seconds later i'd be going "DOH! that guy was homeless!" then i'd poke Wes and say "we shoulda talked to him!" and wes would give me this look and guy "yeahhh" lol.. yeah so anyways we were running low on time so we went and grabbed some korean BBQ from fob court (off telegraph ave) and went back to a man i'd felt particularally bad blowing off. he was african american, 45 years old and seemed pretty spirited. he was really easy to talk to and was reallly happy about the food and told us that he'd been a cook at a hospital before he was kicked out cuz of cost cutting or whatever. nowhere to go, he got stuck on the street and to this day, he's been applying for jobs everywhere. it's really sad actually. throughout the entire conversation he would be going "yeah, but i'm never gonna give up. never"

i could see that he was just another human being, and it really saddened my heart that i took him to be a total bum. you know, subhuman or something. sigh..

**IF YOU HAVENT MADE SENSE OF ANYTHING SO FAR (or got bored to death), READ THIS**

so on saturday we went over to Oak Park, a really run down apartment complex over a few blocks away from Harbor House. this place has experienced everything, from drugs to violence to poverty. but what's really interesting are the people that live in it.

we met this couple named Russell and Joanne that lived in this apartment complex. what's cool is that they could be doing SO MUCH BETTER with what they have, yet they chose to live here. let me explain.

Russell went to **Stanford** and finished his graduate degree at **Berkeley**. Joanne went to **Harvard**. does that not blow your mind? crazy brainpower right there. must be the asian pressure, no doubt =P but thats where the similarities end.

bout 10 years ago Russell and a few of his friends decided to move into the apartment complex so they could really do God's work there in the complex. they organized the community, kicked out the gangs w/ help of police, started a church and a preschool and even helped the people sue and kick out their bad landlord and get a better one.

Joanne came to Oakland seeking more urban ministry opportunities cuz God really gave her a heart for the people there, and there she interned for HH and got introduced to Russell. they soon fell in love and got married (aww thats so sweet haha). as Russell told us, it was like "one day, Joanne walks into the door and I was like 'oh, thanks God!'" hahahahaha.. but yeah that may be the one thing that sticks out so vividly in my mind. at their wedding ceremony, they had the chinese traditional ceremony, the korean bowing ceremony and at the very end, the kids put on a break dance comp.

lol.. that's so awesome. it was like.. i've been afraid of what would happen if i was to follow God's calling.. what if i _(gasp)_ were to go into ministry!? and i've always assumed that i'd be like.. living miserably cuz i'd give up all my material wealth.

but you know what? russell and joanne seemed to be totally happy. totally content. totally filled with joy. yes, even if their apartment neighbors were blasting the mariachi music (with the bass cranked up) or even if the kids were running in and out of their unlocked door all the time, they were totally happy. and you know what? i've never seen that before with my own eyes.

heck, they could be making 6 figures each, no sweat. russell's a professor at SFU and Joanne's a residential care assistant over at some hospital, so their jobs arent bad or anything. but its the way they chose to live their lifestyle in God's will that blew me away. blew all of us away. and i think God was teaching us something that day.

well that sums up the urban plunge experience. sorry if it's been a long read, thanks for suffering all the way here, congratulate yourselves! haha hope you got as much out of it as i did.
