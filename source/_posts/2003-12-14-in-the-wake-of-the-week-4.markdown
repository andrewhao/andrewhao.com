this week's been quite the busy.. wheww.

**from stanford, with love**: yes, stanford love came in the form of a thin envelope this wednesday. and in all honestly, i'd been expecting it. hearing about the admission of chris and diane and walter had my hopes lifted for a quick three hours or so.. but i guess not  8O  it's quite all right.. there's really no use running "what ifs" through my head at all. what if i had spent more time on the app, what if the app system hadn't cut my essay off at the last sentence, what if i'd written essays that didn't suck.. ahha they all went through my mind. but like my dad says.. "it's out of your hands now". and i suppose that's the truth. first choice now? MIT. probable rejection? from MIT. i can almost see myself ending up at UCberk now.. thoughts on that at a later date.

GOd's intention for me wasn't to be at stanford, so it's all good in the hood. where I am is where You'll want me to be.

**praise night** could NOT have happened without a healthy dose of the HOLY SPIRIT in the hizzouse! let me say this: for every time we as leaders messed up, for every attack from Satan that we got, God fixed it up and blessed us even more! there were crazy people from random places just showing up and i thought that was so awesome. the joy of God was in that place, and i'd like to thank everyone for coming =) thanks also to the 5HOCers on my worship team.. you guys sacrificed a lot to practice with us and were just darn cool to work with  :D

but ya.. that night pretty much exhausted me. we went out to pho afterwards and the guys went on to paul's to hang out. i needed to go home and conk out for a good 10 hours. nice.

**key club resurrection** okay, so i've been the worst of members recently. cuz of marching band and cross country i've been able to do umm.. zero events. which means, in essence, zero points. which made me feel slightly guilty.

dcm was held at fremont hs, tianqi and hannah busted out good $$ for that food, thanks guys =) afterwards we went caroling for cans.. you know, we'd show up on doorstops and ask for canned good items. then we'd sing - not too well. hilarity ensued.

key club for me has never been for points.. first cuz i could never hit the requirement for a cord. second, cuz i think it takes away from the point of community service.

**from MIT, with love** well i got my MIT interview with a Mr. Ronald Koo today. honestly I didn't prepare anything at all besides a little portfolio of my graphics design/creative writing work. no memorized answers, no strategic smiles when necessary. it was pretty comfortable.. we had things to talk about for the entire 1.5 hours. MIT is an awesome place yo and i really would love to go. but uh.. you guys probably won't want me there. ahhahaha

but i was telling him how i ideally wanted to combine digital media/design with the discipline of engineering. i dont know how in the world that would work, but MIT's got some pretty creative program and research places i'd be interested in checking out. kind of like how if i went to USC i'd be interested in cross-applying in some film/media classes. it's cool stuff.

**bio stupor** has taken over my body. like i know i need to finish my 3232432 worksheets and labs and study all 20323 chapters from scratch.. but i can't get started! writing this entry has already stolen 20 precious minutes from me. not that i'd be eager to start, but you know.

anyways, the week's been amazingly busy but rewarding. finals are next week, winter formal is next week, winter break is next week, bring it on.
