so i ended up being kept pretty busy today, who knew that break could tire you out so much? tried to help out jimmy chen's computer (which seems to be beyond hope) this morning.. we didnt really get anywhere and that was pretty disappointing. ah well..

bunch of us from church went to see shanghai knights today. at 2PM, i got there and found that (surprise).. the 2PM showing was sold out. man.. it's already a week out and it's STILL sold out? _wow_, i thought. it must either be **a really good movie **or **people are really desperate**.

well it turned out to be a combination of both. okay so "shanghai knights" isnt exactly oscar-award winning but it wasnt too bad. don't go to see it for the plot, or even for the girl (she wasnt THAT pretty  8O <- going to get killed for saying that).. but instead for the action sequences. there's this one sequence where jackie, in trademark jackie chan style, takes out the bad guys one by one using everything he can get his hands on.. you've gotta see it for yourself. hilarious.

anyways.. i spent the rest of the day running errands so that really tired me out. agape core meeting went a bit overtime but that's probably cuz we were being immature and cracking bad jokes half the time  :)  lol it's awesome.. you guys are great.

ski trip tomorrow! i'm pretty excited.. pastors peter and thomas plus four of us guys going up to tahoe for a few days of some fun.. you bet i'm excited. only problem is that my mom's egging me to finish my homework and i'm finding it tough to make an excuse...
