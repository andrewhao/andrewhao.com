I'm glad you could all make it to this important event. I think we're going to start this on time, if you could all take a seat. Donuts are there on that table to the right -- hey you, only one per person! -- and there is some coffee right next to it. No, you don't have to pay for them. And you again, just one.

So let's get started, if we could only get this Powerpoint slideshow set up. Please, no flash photography during the presentation. I'll be signing autographs later -- ha ha, bad joke.

_(Awkward silence)_

_(Soft whir and a flash of light as projector warms up).

All: Ooooh._

Ahem. I promise you this will be brief, quick and painless, let's begin. You in the back, step away from the donuts.

What you see before you is my promise to you assembled here. It is my compact, my bargain, my oath, if you will of my conduct and behavior here in college. Let's begin.

**I SHALL:** shower every day. If not in the morning, then at night. If not at night, then in between classes, using the men's restroom sink as a shower faucet and drying my head with paper towels.  Personal hygiene is a personal must.

**I SHALL:** brush my teeth, wear my retainer and floss. On the same plane as personal hygiene is a need for good hygiene habits. No more crooked, rotten teeth for me. And I get really freaked out by that dentist's drill.

**I SHALL:** do my devotions daily, because there is nothing more important than an active relationship with God and hearing what He has for me. This should be number one on my list, and should followed up by people who aren't afraid to ask me how my relationship is doing. In the event of a failure to comply, I give permission to my brothers to give me several swift kicks to the butt.

**I SHALL:** read the book. Go to discussion, lecture, lab, the whole shebang. I shall do it even if it hurts, and no doubt it will. I will give everything my academic all. You in the back, I know you're laughing. Shut up.

**I SHALL:** be relational with my hallmates. I shall not become a study hermit holed up in my room. I will laugh with them, talk with them, I will be real with them and genuinely care for them. Not cuz I'm forcing myself to but as an outpour of God's love for me.

**I SHALL:** stay away from girls in the romantic sense. For at least this year. Because even though girls look nice, talk nice, think nice and especially smell nice, a romantic relationship will prevent me from making more friends and will kill my study life. There, I said it. To help in this endeavour, I shall dress scrubby and continue to grow out that nasty goatee.

**I SHALL:** keep a positive attitude, even when my grades are tanking. I will stay levelheaded and keep a good perspective even though my academic, personal or social life isn't what I want it to be.

**I SHALL:** get plugged into a small group and church, fast.

**I SHALL:** maintain ties with friends from home, even though they're tens or hundreds of miles away, they're still my friends.

And so there you have it. Meeting is adjourned, glad you could make it. Grab some more donuts on your way out, I can't finish those, really.
