We meet Douglas, Nelisha, Faith, and friends to share some coffee on our final evening.

We made it safely back in one piece! Thanks for your continual prayer and support, we couldn't have experienced all this without you. 




## One morning, I woke to a revelation that I fear a life wasted.




I realized that one of my biggest fears was that if I were to totally surrender my life to follow Jesus anywhere, I'd become irrelevant. My skills and talents and education and training would be wasted. I wouldn't reach my potential as a Web developer, a designer, an entrepreneur, a musician, or a writer.




_Would I follow Christ if it meant being:_






  * a laughingstock?


  * mocked and despised?


  * alone?


  * wasted potential?


  * poor?




_Do I believe that having Christ is worth far more than:_






  * a career?


  * familiar friends?


  * a relationship?


  * a comfortable life?




Morning after morning, I'd stare these questions in the face and wrestle with the voices in my head. Could I really "deny [myself], take up [my] cross" and follow him? (Mk. 8:34) Even if it meant a life wasted in the world's eyes?




## I was reminded that God is my Treasure, and he is worth far more than anything I can lay claim to.




No matter how I wrestled with it, I realize that none of my fears held any water in the grand scheme of it all. I couldn't make it work out in such a way where I could justify a life that was surrendered to God with one half and still held onto the other half.




I couldn't deny the richness of the Gospel diamond. I couldn't feel content with a lukewarm existence.




Ultimately, I was reminded that the my greatest desire was to enjoy God, and I couldn't do it unless Jesus really was my Treasure.




About halfway through this trip, I started feeling peace. It was a simple, quiet contentment in living: _I have really cool friends here_ and _my skills are useful_ and the _mosquitos have stopped biting, gosh I'm almost comfortable_. 




I'm realizing that I was happy not because my conditions for my life were met-that my potential would be realized, or what I had to offer would be utilized-but that I could trust a God who would provide for me, where ultimately he himself was my great reward.




Collin Tomikawa once told us, "you don't know how strong the altar is until you put the weight of your entire life on it." 




## That's what I've been learning: that to know the will of God in my life, I must stake my life on the altar and trust.




Trust-that as I give it all, my good Father lavishes gifts on me: a solid community, fulfillment in using my skills,  and the ultimate gift of Jesus himself. Not to use these benefits as preconditions for surrender, but to hunger for the treasure of Christ so much that these benefits are "count[ed] as rubbish" in the ultimate calculus of this new life.




I've got a lot to learn, and a lot of listening to do as I return home. I don't have concrete answers about the future just yet, but I trust that I'll hear them in the right timing. I've told God that I'm open to wherever he's going to lead me, be it in ministry, in the workforce or in something completely unforeseen and different. I know he's my good Father, my Treasure, and I can follow Him.
