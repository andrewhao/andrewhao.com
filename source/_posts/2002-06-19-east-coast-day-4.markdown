my goodness.. there was mucho walking done today. and i mean a _lot_.

so we were gonna walk the 'freedom trail' in boston. this thing is basically a red line either made of brick or painted onto the crosswalks that leads all through downtown boston. it's supposed to take you through all the important historical landmarks from the colonial times. in theory, this thing's really cool.

but throw in all the foot traffic, the 80 degree heat and the miles of walking involved, and this thing really painful, really fast. somehow i walked past the site of the boston massacre and other really important landmarks without noticing it. probably was more intent on getting to the next shaded bench as fast as possible. yeah..

five hours later we somehow stumbled back into the van. my dad found some cheap motel on the outskirts of boston and we stayed there for the night. *yawn* i'm tired, gonna head off to sleep. i'll post this thing tomorrow.
