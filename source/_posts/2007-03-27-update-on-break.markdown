Hello all, just checking in from home with a few important announcements:  


  * Snowboarding with the IV juniors was swell this weekend. Highlights included massive foodage, laughter, a lack of snow and sweet convos. I see Jesus in them all and that is most definitely a blessing.. Photos shall come soon.
  * I did my taxes for the first time in my life. It was kind of fun, kind of like filling out a really long secret crush survey except at the end you just have to pay money. I realized things would get much worse once we get things like "mortgages" and "1099-DIVs".
  * Man, suburbia is nice, if only because it's familiar.  

  * I swallowed a piece of gum today and I believe it's causing some sort of blockage down in the gastrointestinal regions. No, it's not what you think, but I've just been burping frequently. Contrary to urban legend, [gum will not stick in your stomach for seven years.](http://ask.yahoo.com/20010223.html)  

  * I am also embarking on a trip to Central Asia with my church this summer and I'm (somewhat) freakin' scared. I will choose to walk in faith. Ask me about it in person, wontcha?
  * I'm heading back to Berkeley tomorrow morning with Alex Choy to get some EECS150 work done the rest of the week. Wishing I could see you all (come up and visit?) :D
