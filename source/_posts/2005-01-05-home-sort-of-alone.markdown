Trying to catch up with old friends before they're all gone. And gone they are, quite soon. Faces not seen for awhile remain unseen. Aw drat.

I have some sort of phobia of returning to high school to see teachers. I'd have this nightmare of walking into a classroom and getting blank stares from teachers. And they'd try to be nice about it but that couldn't hide up not knowing my name. But all that would change as I'd open my mouth and tell them my exploits of the past semester racking a 4.0 GPA, mentoring thirty-three underprivileged children, starting my own fan club (2050 VLSB, Wednesdays at 8!) and sing the praise of DC food. Then I'd be escorted off campus by an assistant principal, but at least I got to buy a crispy burrito in the lunch line.

A friend showed me what it means to be vulnerable and live generously today. It showed. Probably a small gesture on his part in retrospect but it made a big impression on me.

Yesteerday I bought some clothes I did not need. Somewhere in Eastern Europe, a puppy died.
