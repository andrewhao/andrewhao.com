i'm learning to live boldly, recklessly, unashamedly. how can I be ashamed of the One who gave me everything? God make us radical, make us extreme.

this is a generation which has seen the extremes of everything.. extreme violence, extreme hate, and extreme lust and it's been met with nothing but emptiness. when are we going to show extreme LOVE, extreme COMPASSION, extreme UNITY?

i feel like i've forgotten the call, i've lost my purpose in the midst of my accomplishments, my grades, my image, whatever stupid selfish stuff i've been mired in.

God, i don't wanna be "that nice guy" ten years down the road. i wanna be an agent of your love that brings life to a dying campus. and i'm honestly a little scared. me, flaws, pimples, boogers and all?

You have huge dreams for me. i forgot that. You're everything. i forgot that.
