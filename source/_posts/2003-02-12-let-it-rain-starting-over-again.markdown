well it finally rained today.. i always love it when it rains cuz it really clears everything up afterwards. when i was young i used to love cloudy days... they just gave me a good vibe. don't ask why. that's just how it was.

that was your random flashback of the day. speaking of rain, i decided to skip track practice cuz i've been recuperating from a cold from the last couple of days. however.. i started suffering a guilt sequence and in the end i just decided to get out there and run a lil by myself. yeah i know it sounds crazy cuz i'm just gonna get myself sick again but.. i did it anyways. what can i say? i run distance. i'm crazy. sue me. o_O

the computer screen lies to me.
