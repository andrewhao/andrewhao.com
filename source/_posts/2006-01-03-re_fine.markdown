I think what marks and defines this semester was the sheer amount of what I learned about myself. The good, bad, and (mostly) ugly. It chipped away at a ton of my pride and left me with like.. tarnished bits and pieces of my character. Hey, can I say this? I'm FREAKIN PRIDEFUL. And I hold onto that, hard. And that's why I was partially surprised at (the sheer depth of) emotions that ran through me: the bitterness, judgement and (man, this one sucks) jealousy. I'm working my way (slowly) through these but phew.. I've learned so much. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.

And I'm so thankful for you folks who walked with me. You know who you are; you listened to my frustrations, you spoke gentle words of criticism. You helped me with insane problem sets, you made me smile, you paid for the meal, you cooked the meal, you listened to (non)girlproblems (and most likely laughed). You reminded me to rest, you prayed for me, you never strongarmed me into doing things, but you led by example and I admire you so much for that.

You were my role models, you were my brothers, sisters, my family. To have you, I am blessed.
