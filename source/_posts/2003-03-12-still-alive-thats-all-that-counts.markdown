today's one of those days that you're glad to still be standing on two feet.. heck, you'd be glad to not be in the hospital hacking your lungs or whatever vital organs out. but si.. tis good to be alive  :D  now if only my quads, my shins, my hamstrings and my neck would feel the same sort of appreciation too, that'd be great.. :neutral:

man.. junior prom is a-coming up in two weeks or so and i'm still sitting on the fence. i don't doubt at all that it'll be fun (i know it'll be great  ;) ), and it _is_ prom and all.. but there's just oh so many factors to weigh in as well. honestly guys, don't make such a big deal over the dates.. go with someone that you feel comfortable with and you know you'll have fun with and you'll have an awesome time. not that there's actually anything wrong with going stag =D

well.. the deadline is coming up soon and i've yet to make a decision.. we'll see about all this soon enough.

agape potluck on monday (no school!) so come on out and hang out with all of us.. it'll be fun and the food will be good, we promise =D

man.. do you know how madly God is in love with you? no matter how low or worthless or dirty you feel.. the awesome creator of the universe is crazy over you and wants you to run into His arms.. dang.. God is good, all the time and i do mean all the time. this is real, guys, and i guess you can say that i can't stop trippin'  :)

anyways here's some old track photos taken 'bout 2 weeks ago @ santa clara for your viewing enjoyment. please take a few minutes to take a sneak peek at the future studs of america:
