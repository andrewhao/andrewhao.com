funny how this works. its march already and then things are gonna start zooming by...

it's sad how the musical's already done and over with after all the time the actors have spent putting into it. it's been a lotta fun playing with the pit orchestra and i'm gonna miss the butt-numbing waits, the bad barbershop quartet imitations "ice creaaammmm", all the times doc's screamed at the clarinets (forreals), beatboxing to bad beats, rave moves to "pick-a-little", brian park's piano skillz, and the blood circulation boogie...

i've already started getting nostalgic about this year already. i'm haunted by the fear that next year i'm going to look back and wish i had savored everything more. i'm gonna miss the music program, last night i was staring out at the audience and just realizing that i was gonna miss _this_, whatever it was, that feeling, i was gonna miss it.

okay enough cheesy stuff. my ankle's healed again to the point where i think i can play in tomorrow's 3v3 tournament. should be a good matchup, i'm gonna have nightmares about making a fool of myself on the court though  :!:

i'm piling responsibilities on myself and i'm starting to feel them topple over. what have i gotten myself into..

funny how this works.
