Then throw it all into piles and funnel them into boxes. You don't need that trinket and Lord knows when the last time you took a look at that photograph. Some of these people don't even know you anymore. Should you keep or should you toss? Come on homie, who are you kidding, you should have gotten rid of that years ago. Tear those posters off the walls; you've outlived those. That's not you anymore. There's a reason time only moves forward and takes you along with it.

Donate the rest of the stuff to the library. Pack it off to the dumpster. Nobody needs it. We need to stay organized. We need that extra space. All that clutter is suffocating. Repeat it after me. Suff--o--ca--ting.

Trust us, you'll work better this way. You won't feel so distracted. You don't want this stuff around anymore--what makes you think anybody else does?

Have you had your time to reminisce? Good, now move on. Life doesn't wait for you, neither should you for it.
