went to taimur's house tonight and kindasorta chemstudied haha.. we had quite a few people there so it got really confusing at times. but hey.. its all good. chemistry is my life (so it seems).

went swimming in the pool again today.. and my thigh is spontaneously twitching pretty bad. what a weird feeling. i'm not gonna run tomorrow.. i've decided that much. hopefully this extra weekend will whip me back into a healthy condition.

on a plus note, i got the car back! woohoo.. my dad's car broke down and he had to borrow mine to use for the time being. man.. you dont realize what you've got till it's gone. true dat.
