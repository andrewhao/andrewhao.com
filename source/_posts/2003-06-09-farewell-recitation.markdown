the memories flood back, and i watch them lap at my bare feet.

they tell stories of unfettered youth, of vitality and a life spent in the spotlight. of dancing when nobody's watching, of unstoppable grinning and uncontrollable laughter.

they surround me and remind me why life is worth living, is worth crying, is worth being a fool for.

but grasping at them, they slip through my fingers and rush away with the tide. and i know that they are not meant to be kept, to be held on to.

and i know you're going to be gone, but thank you! i hope you had the time of your life  :idea:
