ever had one of those weeks where you just keep feeling hungry? like you can't stop stuffing your face and even when you're done 30 minutes later you've got this craving for something more?

yeah, that was me all this week. then yesterday i got this massive stomachache -- i guess that was my stomach's payback.

ow ow ow ow owowow 8O

i've got to start making the best of the rest of my year. there's only so much time left and i'm wasting it over stupid academics. so these senior projects are ruining my life (bio video, english paper, APCS program) and they're what i've been caught up in all this week.

you see, that's the story of my high school life. get stuck in homework, don't care about anything else. i know it's what i've been taught, i've been buried in my work forever and it's been ingrained into my mind but i've got to RELAX FOR ONCE.

sit back? enjoy your life?

i caught myself wondering whether i could sneak some homework up to my youth group leadership retreat this weekend.. that's not only pretty sad, but it's a reflection of how messed my priorities are.

i was sharing with channing and a couple of other brothers and they're like dude andrew.. you've got good intentions and good desires but you just don't have TIME for things.

so i've gotta get my priorities straight. God . family . friends . health . school - it's been backwards for too long. and with senior year slipping out of my fingers, i'm losing chances to meet up and talk and just get to know people i thought i knew these past four years.

okay on a lighter note, the Main Street Singers (walter chang jon liao and me) performed yesterday @ battle of the bands and it was GREAT! well it was actually pretty terrible acoustically speaking (walter's viola couldn't get miked up!) but dood it was fun stuff. and that completes number seven on my Things to Do When You're A Senior list: Make a Fool of Yourself, Onstage.

so okay andrew. even though your world is spinning round and you seem to lose control of everything, just grab onto something solid.

Lyrics to "I Wish I Were", as performed by the Main Street Singers

i wish i were a bird
cuz if i was a bird
i could take wing high above you
you could watch my white wings flap
and i would take a great big crap
on anyone who tried to hurt you
and then i would desert you
flying southward in the fall...
i don't wanna be a bird after all.

i wish i was a deer
cuz if i was a deer
we could play out in the meadow
until you shot me by mistake
then you would carve me into steak
with a touch so sweet and gentle
keep my head as a memento
hanging in the upstairs hall...
i don't wanna be a deer after all

i wish i were a dog
cuz if i was a dog
i'd do tricks to show i love you
i'd run and fetch the stick
and i would sit back down and lick,
my privates, when your mom came over
and if i was your rover
i'd have my testicles recalled...
i don't wanna be a dog after all

i wish i was a monkey
cuz if i was a monkey
i would be your furry jester
whenever you were blue
you could see me at the zoo
my antics would be reassuring
but, i'd always reek of urine
and throw my feces at the wall...
i don't wanna be a monkey after all
