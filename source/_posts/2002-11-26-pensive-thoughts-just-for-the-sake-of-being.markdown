sorry to those who've been staring at the same profile time and time again.. i've been so busy (ahem wasting my time) that i havent had the chance to blog.

man.. thanksgiving break means winter retreat and i'm really really pumped. good time to get away from all the stress and the pressure and just to have awesome times with friends and a good spiritual refreshing. a lot of people can't make it this year.. man.. i feel bad for you guys. victor quon of SJCAC is coming over and speaking for us youth.. i'm pretty excited about it because i know him from his frequent visits to Agape here @ lynbrook.. yeaaaaa :)

i have two video projects to work on over break.. one spanish soap opera in spanish class (no duh) and one lit video on the Scarlet Letter from.. lit. haha.. our lit group is so awesome and we're gonna go soooo over the top. we've really got a lot planned out.. but i hope we're not being too overambitious  :)  nah we got cool people. if i get the chance, i'll post some vid clips and/or MP3s.. haha this'll be so cool =P

yeah.. only problem is i have to learn how to vid edit in less than a week.. that could be a problem.

ordered a bunch of stuff online.. your normal geek stuff. i wont bore you all with what it is, but it's exciting nonetheless.

one of these days, i will do my first survey sometime.. ahha since when do guys do surveys? i know the answer.

[edit 6:01PM]
it kind of stinks when you can't say no to people.. can't turn them down. sigh.. i think that sometimes i'm too nice. been taken advantage of more than a few times and i really hate it x.x

on a different note today.. i messing on the guitar today and i guess i was getting a little carried away. the pick just kind of flew outta my fingers and flew like.. 10 feet away. yikes. new record.
