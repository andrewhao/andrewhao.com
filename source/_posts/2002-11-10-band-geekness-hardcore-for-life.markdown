a whole entry dedicated to band.. whoa.. how hardcore andrew hahaha. man.. today's just been so.. full. so full of fun and excitement and emotion and it reminded me again of why i joined and love mb in the first place.

man.. the weather really hated us today. we were practicing in the afternoon on one of napa high's practice fields when it started raining moderately hard and we had to get back to the buses to grab ponchos. when we got back out, the SUN came out and we were left boiling in the heat. yowch. muddy field but it was a good rehearsal.

channing, jesse, daphne and I worked on the "secret project". that is.. stringing glowsticks without letting people know we were.. stringing glowsticks. so we climbed into the luggage compartments of one of the buses and attempted to work in secret from there. lol.. it didnt work.

then came the lynbrook tradition of the flower ceremony. this was where it got really emotional. it felt so sad.. this was the last competition ever for the seniors and honestly i never realized how soon it would be for my turn to walk up there as a four year marcher. a lot of people were crying and feeling generally sad - **seniors, we're gonna miss you all!**

speaking of the weather hating us, the real kicker came in the field show. we were warming up when we began to feel this little sprinkle-drops on our hands. no big deal right? my baby cousin spits up more than that. but soon enough it began to rain harder and harder. it became a downpour right when we lined up to enter the field. but dang.. we were so confident at that moment. we werent about to let any rain stop us from marching an awesome show and let me tell you this was the best show i've marched in my life.

well okay, it might as well be flooding. the field is half water and i'm getting water in my underwear. **half my vision is obscured by driving sheets of rain.** my clarinet pads are soaked and my reed is jacked. and this probably happened to everybody else.

but dang. there was this total energy that i remember feeling.. this vibe from everybody. we were totally cohesive and totally locked in to our drum major. people said that we had such a powerful sound (i wonder if the rain did that) and man.. those sets were awesome. straight lines straight like nothing before. crazy marching techniques. and what pumped me up the most was the crowd. **THE CROWD LOVED IT**. dude those roars on the stands totally made me march so much better. there was such a energy on the field tonight and i dont think i'm gonna forget that for a lonnnnng time  :) i could NOT stop smiling you guys.. that was the most fun i've had in a long time. props to the hardcore marching band.

final note:
one thing i remember is Andrew from the pit playing the timpani in the rain. water would collect on the timpani drum head and when he struck it, sheets of water would rise up (it was almost like slo-mo from the movies). really memorable haha.

sure, i would've liked more credit (i thought we should've scored much higher) for our scores, but we didn't score half bad. we were 3rd in our division, 1st drum major, 3rd woodwinds and 3rd brass. hey.. not too shabby when everything's considered.

non marching bander? sorry for confusing you. all your base are belong to us next year. you know it will.
