So I have these two good friends of mine. And they're getting hitched. I came to know Brendan first as he was my Intervarsity small group leader sophomore year. The next year, I joined a small group with my church, The Berkeley Mosaic. To my delight, Brendan and Elizabeth were in the group too. You have got to meet these two in person. Brendan's wit combined with Elizabeth's joy is a sight to behold. Way to go you two, you make me smile.
