Look up, look up, look up, look up. Life is far too beautiful, far too valuable to waste it on yourself. It is a gift; you are to love, live, give breathe. We were made with too many holes, I think. They accumulate, these scrapes and bruises as we teeter off bicycles, miss appointments, exhale molten words, savor bittersweet kisses and sing lullabies. The holes always accumulate, they always multiply. It's a disease, this keeping up with the Joneses of America, and our hearts sink further and further when we understand these holes go deeper than we had believed.

There was once a man, sixty years from zero, with so many holes he could no longer be seen. Nobody mourned for him.

May you have life, and may you have it to the Full.  
May we find that the greatest satisfaction is found in our greatest Delight.  
Of one who gave Himself for us,  
Full of holes, big ones, little ones, heart-wrenching ones,  
And filled them wholly with himself, perfect Love

Oh, look up, for life is too short to blow it all.
