inside my brain, there is one voice that tells me what i should be doing. quit wasting time and go study, it says. don't eat that crispy burrito, here's a bagel instead. take a shower have some self control clean your room and for heaven's sake comb your hair.

then the other voice kicks in. nahh.. it says. you can do that after your nap.

naturally, i obeyed the second voice. i mean, what's a half-conscious kid to do?

felt pretty pooped today.. dozing off in half my classes and doing 5.5 miles in the hills in practice afterwards.. that's enough to tire you out for two days. bless the sophomores and their little sophomore hearts.. and Gray Davis and the HSEE and late morning sunshine and sleeping in and good warm fuzzy stuff.

anyways.. online time is now cut down to 1 hour and limited to homework AIM and some blogging.. no blogsurfing for another month because honestly that is one major factor in academic downfall.

man, i can't feel my legs. back to work.
