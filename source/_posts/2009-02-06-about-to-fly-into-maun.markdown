### The photos that almost weren't




So do you see those photos I just uploaded? Let's just say that getting them online came at a price. So the story is that because I was so busy editing photos on the computer, I lost track of time (strangely enough, that's the story of my life). We had a frenzied-yet-hilarious adventure checking out of the hotel, miserably dragging our luggage to Paddington station in the rain, and nearly missing the Heathrow Connect train to Heathrow because I was hungry (hey, I really was!) and needed to grab some breakfast.




Then in Dubai as I'm uploading them to the blog, we nearly miss our boarding call. As we're sprinting to the terminal, bags flailing about us, I see my life pass before my eyes, capped by a slow-mo montage of Sarah destroying me with her fists or her glare (equally horrible fates). Luckily, we just shared a good chuckle. If we missed our flight(s), however, I'm sure the outcomes would be much different.




So, please do enjoy the photos. If you'd like to see more, [keep track of my Flickr stream](http://flickr.com/photos/andrewhao) through the trip, provided I survive that long.




### Heading to Maun, Botswana




We're currently staying in Johannesburg for the night at a really cool guest house the mission referred us to. The weather's nice and balmy here (they say it's really weird weather for this placeâ€¦ normally the place would be an oven). The neighborhood here is relatively upscale, more reminiscent of a strip mall straight out of California. There's also a bit of a jarring transition as we notice the power dynamics between the whites and African nationals here in this neighborhood. That, and we're pretty much the only Asian people around, so we do attract our fair share of looks.




I'm definitely a bit nervous now as I think about arriving tomorrow. What are the nationals like, or the staff at LBOM? What's the weather like? Will I be able to make friends? How do I feel about being Taiwanese-American in this context? A software engineer? Will I feel useless (my friend Alvin says yes, absolutely)? I think there's just a lot of questions that are floating in my head and I need peace about.




Although it's a bit nerve-wracking, I'm definitely at peace. Some tough things have come up this week, and as Sarah and I press onward I'm more convinced that we can trust Jesus to keep being good.




### Oh yeah, my luggage broke and hilarity ensued




So I forgot to mention how my carry handle on my suitcase snapped en route from SFO to London. Which caused us problems today when we were scrambling to Paddington Station, because I was trying to jury-rig a contraption to drag the suitcase while maintaining a high rate of speed. Sarah has diagrammed this for us:
