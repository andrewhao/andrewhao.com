here is the unqualified romantic subject of the month:

i was never quite certain why some girls fall for the bad guys. actually i'm not qualified to judge who's bad or who's not (i'm sure not) but is it because the [guys] get more attention? have more outgoing personalities? or is it something intrinsic about that bad boy image that's chemically attractive to the female neurological system? knaamean?

leave a comment.. what do you think?
