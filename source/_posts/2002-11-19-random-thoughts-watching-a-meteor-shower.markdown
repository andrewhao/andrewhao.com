went outside to watch the meteor shower tonight. it's been so long since i've actually gone outside and watched one. wow.. there were so many of them. some of them were just.. barely noticeable out the corner of your eye or there were these intense ones that looked like flares.

man.. the sky was so amazing.. sort of shows us how God never even forgets the little things.. the details that make this world so worth living in.

but then my feet got cold and the shadows of the trees were getting creepy and so i went back in. yeah, i'm a wuss at heart.

_coldplay - trouble_ - this gives me so many memories.. of.. something. i dunno. listening to some old songs makes me remember of times past. only i cant remember what. i just get sad when i hear it.

i need more sad songs.. no reason in particular.
