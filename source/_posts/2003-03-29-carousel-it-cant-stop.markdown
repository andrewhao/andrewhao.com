my friend tam once brought something up that really struck me:

"i don't know if i'd rather have no life and be bored all day or if i'd rather have a busy schedule and be rushed."

i dont think i've ever known the former. i've always wished for those summer lazy days where you sit around and do nothing and be bored out of your mind. seriously. i want to be bored out of my mind.

but somehow along the way life thought it'd be a funny joke if it threw everything at me at once. i willingly signed into the deal too, trying to do too much with too little abilities.

so here i am, caught in the catch. shoulda read the fine print.
