so much for creativity. summer just does that to you.. all the days seem to blend into some sort of faceless featureless thing.. that really doesnt seem to hold any meaning. er yeah.

i dunno. why am i complaining? ya gotta treasure this andrew. gotta hold onto every last bit of boringness so as to compensate for the start of the school year - a mere 30-ish days from now.

ugh.. thats not cool. i mean, a part of me is wishing i could see some friends again.. the other part of me is regretting all the goals i never met and another part is kicking and screaming. really really hard.

learned something today: you should never wash cars with dishwashing fluid or detergent. uhm... NOW i know. guess what. 2004 has been washing cars (probably 70+?) with dishwashing soap this summer. whoops. i just hope the car wash-ees dont notice any stripping of wax =X

junior class going to volunteer at moffett field airshow tomorrow.. we're gonna meet at 6:45. wah.. i should be asleep. gonna be a zombie tomo.
