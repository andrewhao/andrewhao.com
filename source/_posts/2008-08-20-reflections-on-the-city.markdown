With a City like this, calamities are bound to happen. A elderly man slips down a narrow stairwell and dislocates his hip. Sirens interrupt throngs of hungry shoppers as two ladder trucks rush down the Market. A red-headed biker caroms off a distracted SUV, and snaps his collarbone. Blaring phones put 911 operators on edge. A toddler stops to admire the red-metal monsters. Around the corner, a girl sizes up a pencil skirt through a store window.

Hungry eyes follow you over concrete bridges. To look away from them is to acknowledge their power over you. To gaze back into them is to compel you into backbreaking compassion. Apathy, it seems, tries to do both and none at all.
