track meet vs los altos today went decently well. i got burned by all the underclassmen, but i am proud to say that my times are going down and not the other way around. if i can break 5:12 i can die a happy man, and i'll never let my kids hear the end of it. "did you know that your father took half of his high school career to beat his career record of 5:12 but in april of 2004 he was able to beat it? did you? huh?" to which they'd respond "yeah yeah dad and you ate goat cheese for breakfast, lunch AND dinner" to which i'd respond "that's RIGHT" (when it wasn't) and to which they would knowingly roll their eyes at each other and to which i'd say "don't give me that attitude.. go to your rooms and do your homework!" and they would instead flip the channel to jay leno (who would still be on at the age of 84) mocking president george Z. bush the third and i would lose them to a darn television, for cryin' out loud.

goal for the next two weeks: get a kick. who cares if you faint at the finish line. kick the last 200m.
