eh.. so i've been away from the comp for so long. mostly cuz i've been held up with the lit video project. who knew that video editing could take so long? i guess i do now.

i feel sorta bad for chris suen's mom.. we've been over at their house for the last three days or so. last night i stayed from 9PM to around.. 4:30AM? bleh.. our whole group is a bunch of overachievers. but she makes a niiiiiiiiice chow mein dish. mm. chris if you're reading this, give props to your mom for me.

had the strangest substitute for korsunsky's calc yesterday. this guy was pretty.. i dunno.. messed up? he seems to be one of those people who don't care about anything. he jsut let us fool around and even joked around with us. what was really messed was how he pulled out the test we were supposed to be having and wrote out three questions from the test on the overhead. "i don't wanna let your grades from keeping you where you wanna go" he joked. gah.. i didnt know what to do. i just kinda stared at my desk. some people just left the room.. kinda wished i had the nerve to do that. but man.. talk about the teacher shortages these days. he was joking with us what would happen if mr. richter walked in on him right there. **that's messed.**

to make a long story short.. korsunsky figured it out. the test was changed. no biggie. i bombed it anyways (mostly cuz i was majorly sleep deprived). but yeah.. the quality of subs you get these days...

today was generally a bad day.. lack of sleep last night made me oversleep and forget the chem lab and math hw and physics work and assorted disasters like that.

okay, back to video editing at chris'. mr. seike better give us major props for this.
