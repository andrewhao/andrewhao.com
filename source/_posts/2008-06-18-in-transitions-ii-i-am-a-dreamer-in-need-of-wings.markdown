I was thinking back to high school today, how idealistic I was (and still am) and passionately I lived. Although these days it seems that I do more reminiscing for those days past than living,Â  today I felt a few gusts of wind and I wanted to fly again.

I remembered how it feels to drive through Cupertino's cookie-cutter streets and eat eight-dollar pizza in air-conditioned strip malls. Yeah, I remembered the excitement of hope & of change. I felt the breathtaking movement of a transformative Kingdom. Nine-to-six, don't bring me down hey hey.

Sometimes I feel that the older I become, the more pragmatic (read: boring) and straightforward (read: staid) I become. It's a metamorphosis I've been trying to figure out for awhile now. Perhaps it comes with age; perhaps it's a side-effect of maturity. I can't quite figure out if it's for the better. I find myself making calculations and cost-benefit analysis on everything from chores to sleep to social gatherings. It feels cold. No, that's not it. It feels divorced from feeling, from impulse and from emotion.

Sarah told me something tonight that gave me pause: "I want to see what worship looks like in the Tenderloin." She believes that transformations can occur in the most hopeless places. She envisions what is not at first visible, but has the faith and confidence that she will see it soon . The girl is a dreamer (yeah, I like that about her.)

And earlier today I saw glimpses of what-could-be. I felt it, and I swear I could taste the hope and joy and peace. This was real; it didn't feel like nostalgia. This was excitement coming out of nowhere. This was peace flooding my heart suddenly. This was new, and yet, it was very, very familiar.

"And although [it might not be what I thought it would be], I know it's there," Sarah finishes. Yeah, would it be there. Would I dream of hope, peace, restoration, Shalom, justice & transformation. Would I know Jesus so closely that all I am able to do is dream.
