man.. i dunno what i can say except that GOd is good. yeah cuz i was feeling pretty darn cruddy today. pretty much zero sleep combined with a lot of pressure and responsibilities.. a killer track workout really started to wear me down.

so i was running our warmdown for the workout and suddenly my whole lower body just cramps up.. so i let the guys move on while i'm just kind of limping/crawling along and it's got to be the loneliest feeling in the world when you're limping along all alone on a road, got a mile or so ahead of you and cars just keep passing you and agh stop the pity party already.

but yeah.. i dunno i think God really filled me back up with some of that joy again today.. and its a kinda satisfaction and a peace knowing it'll be all right. cuz yeah.. man life gets pretty crazy.

it's my dad's official 50th birthday today.. haha wow we're all in awe. half a century is not a small deal at all.. hehe he spent all day cracking jokes about his age. i think about how long i've been around and shoot.. got a long way till 50.

anyways i'm going to start a crazy load of calc tonight.. wish me consciousness please.
