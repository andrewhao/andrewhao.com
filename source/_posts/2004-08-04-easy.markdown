haircut soon? it's getting pretty mongster.

i wonder if my roommate will ever respond to my email. was i too scary? maybe my bad jokes scared him off. or he's just on vacation.

so i came up with this awesome metaphor for life today. so you bikers know that when you're going downhill on the trails it's actually better to keep your momentum and take your chances on the terrain rather than riding the brakes and attempting to avoid all the rocks and ravines. bottom line: don't sweat the small stuff. and always wear your helmet.

finished the site today. after a solid month of work, it feels good. to celebrate, i went to ophelia's and got two cups of PMT and drank it all at once. that's my fix for the week, and for just $2.14. goodness, i feel a little queasy but it was worth it.

oh ya, [http://www.g9labs.com](http://www.g9labs.com) finally gets a facelift, that's the temporary placeholder till i actually get my design portfolio up and running, which will probably be never. 8O

okay it's 4AM and my eyes burn. owwwww
