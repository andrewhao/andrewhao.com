well winter formal was yesterday night and i'm happy to say it was a lotta fun =D there was so much that could've gone wrong but it turned out perfect. to recap:

went to vinny's to meet up with some of the CCIC guys at 4 with andrew yip but then i realized i forgot the corsage.. so we jump back in the car and drive all the way back to cupertino florist and back to vinny's. that was about a total of 40 minutes in the rain and with holiday traffic  :(  it's all good cuz we all got ready within like.. 15 minutes haha (sorry girls) picked up laura and we were about to go to the picture place when we find out that it's closed.. so it's off to the restaurant early..

we checked our reservations there and apparently the restaurant manager didnt have record of our it (hrm?) so we just waited until they could scrounge up enough seating for us. the rest of the group arrived and i guess the management felt sorry for us so we were seated  :)

getting over to the techmart was pretty bad hahaha.. if 30 minutes of wandering around doesnt sound fun to you, i don't know what does =P props to laura for her superb mapreading skills.

but the end story was that we got there in one piece. i havent had that much fun in a loooonnng time and i'm thankful that it turned out the way it did. was it worth it? definitely. thank you laura for making it so fun =P

this morning was so great. i woke up, stared at the "9:30" blinking on my clock and went back to sleep. woke up at 10:30 and went back to sleep. woke up at 11 and decided i couldnt miss a great day like this. it was totally sunny and everything.. my car was all nice and washed from the rain so that was an added plus. went to miyake's at lunch with jack, regina and laura and spent the next three hours after that stuck in holiday traffic, going to the post office, trying to find parking and returning my tux.

but i'm back home now and now i wanna sleep. so i think i will  :) ah the greatness of it all...
