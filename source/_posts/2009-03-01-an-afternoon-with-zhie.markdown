Sure, Jack Bauer sniffs out terrorist sleeper cells to save the world in 24 hours, but did you knowâ€¦




Zhie heads a womens' empowerment project in Maun.  

Zhie harvests maize and peanuts and guavas in her backyard.  

Zhie has provided foster care for a local child.  

Zhie singlehandedly raises at least three kids at home, at least one of whom is an adopted relative.  

Zhie is a community organizer, visiting folks, making connections, informing them of local events.  

Zhie is the cool mom all the kids wish they had.  

Zhie has the coolest backyard in the neighborhood.  

Zhie goes four-wheeling to get to houses out in the remote boroughs.  

Zhie does most of the construction in her home by herself.  

Zhie knows everybody in Maun (or at least seems to).  

Zhie dreams of starting a business of her own.  

Zhie is a social worker, getting families the food they need, doing counseling and advising with folks in the community that need it.  

Zhie probably needs a vacation.




Needless to say, Zhie's pretty cool. We got to hang out with her all of today after church. First we made some sandwiches for lunch. Then we got to work, fixing up her dresser drawer that was coming out. Sarah and I put together a heroic effort to get everything together before storm clouds began rolling in.

Not long after that, we walked over to a local backpackers' camp, where we shared some sodas.

Finally, we enjoyed a traditional meal under the clouds and stars. We had a blast laughing, swapping stories, talking politics, and watching lightning electrify the whole sky.
