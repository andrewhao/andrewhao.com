there's just too much drama with homecoming right now. it's got everybody so emotional right now that i'm seriously worried about going to school tomorrow. it's like a war, almost.

let's take an example of the online war. the **lhsclass2004.com** website is being DoS attacked as you read this. people i know are being flooded with spam emails from lhs_teachers@lhs.fuhsd.org (we're talking anywhere from 500 to 30,000 emails here - seniors have supposedly set up their own spammail server) and on the shoutbox on the website, there's some heated conversation going on right now.

threats? they've been made. i'm now afraid to park my car in the lynbrook parking lot. i dont think there will be many safe places next week..

all because of a few select individuals from our junior class.. i heard there was a lot of in-your-face dissing given to seniors at the hc game and that really made the seniors mad (if they werent already). and now that i think about it.. we may have messed their hc skit (some random yelling in random places).



> PRAYER boi 516 (7:07:24 PM): a lot of seniors are either depressed or extremely angry




> lilesprit9 (12:29:04 AM): do you have any idea how much it hurt
lilesprit9 (12:29:08 AM): when i started walking down the steps
lilesprit9 (12:29:13 AM): of the stadium
lilesprit9 (12:29:21 AM): and i hear this junior (i don't remember who)
lilesprit9 (12:29:27 AM): probably saw me wearing my senior shirt but anyhow
lilesprit9 (12:29:35 AM): i heard her say, 'booyah who's bowing down now?!'


i was sent this page: [ teamdabien.com/read.htm](http://www.teamdabien.com/read.htm) written by a senior.. and when i thought about it i kind of understood how the seniors felt and where they were coming from.

and by now you guys are probably thinking i'm a sellout.. i'm just a senior in disguise blah blah blah. don't get me wrong guys.. i'm totally proud of what we did that day. let's celebrate that.. i'm all for it. but rubbing it in.. that's where i draw a line.

honestly.. it's not even monday (well i guess now it is) and i'm SICK of this so-called rivalry. can't we just drop this? can't we let this go? and apparently it's not going to go anytime soon. this issue is gonna tear up the school for a long long time. we, the juniors deserve props for putting forth an awesome awesome production and pulling it all together. but the seniors too deserve respect not necessarily for the best homecoming skit.. but for the work they put into this for four years. honestly.. i feel that's the best system to work with. if you disagree.. that's fine by me.

so watch it guys. what you say and what you do.. just be careful. i'd really like this to blow over. we'll have to see. but i do know this:

we're not gonna be normal for a long time.
