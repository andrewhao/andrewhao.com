Remember welcome week? Move-in? Didn't it feel like summer camp? Like, _I'm meeting new people, eating terrible food, going to social events, playing sports, sleeping late, this is like camp!_

What they didn't tell you is that school then started, and it was _boot_ camp.

So on my end of things, Charles and I came up first last week to setup the apartment. It was looking pretty good, until Mike showed up on Saturday and totally inundated us with food, kitchenware, suitcases, boxes of who-knows-what, and other good necessary unnecessary stuff.

We are 3 EECS men in a cozy lil apartment. We will spend late nights coding with each other. The other two are smarter than I (am). We are going to hate each other in about 2 weeks. But probably not.
