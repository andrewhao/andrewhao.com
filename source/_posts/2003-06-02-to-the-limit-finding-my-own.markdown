_i'm finding out that trying to be a superhero doesn't earn you extra credit._

sometimes no matter how hard you try, you can't solve everything. i guess i'm learning that the hard way.. its so tough to come to grips with the fact that yes, andrew, you are only human. it's partially a matter of this asian engineer/perfectionist inside of me that can't leave buggy code alone, broken friendships unresolved, mysteries unsolved and wrongs unrighted.

(is "unrighted" a word?) <- (( see what i mean??))  8O

like what warren says.. "everybody WANTS to be a power ranger but not everybody can BE one!"  8) hilarious  :roll:

what i can't shoulder, i leave it in Your hands Jesus.. but so often i can't let it go. so show me how.
