I feel like I've heard so much about stillness and rest that it's just this fuzzy idea up in the ephemeral air that never materializes in real-space. Do I have to fight for stillness (the irony!) I have to work for it, huh? I have to step back and take a big ol' swipe and knock that metaphorical junk off my metaphorical desk. Doubly ironic!  
  
The more I read Jesus' words, the less they make sense to me; is it (no!) so simple?  
Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me (John 15:4)
