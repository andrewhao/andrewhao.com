it's currently 4:47AM as i notice through my bleary eyes, and my mom's still up working on some paper for one of her classes she's taking at Western Seminary. yeah wow.. i just really admire how hard she works to get this counseling degree but sometimes i wonder if it's too much of a strain on her  :sad:

speaking of why i'm up at 5ish on a friday night/saturday morning, i accidentally conked out on the couch tonight.. yeah i'm sorry to all of you guys who needed to reach me online and sat at some old away message for hours on end hehe.. but yeah this week's been pretty tough and my body's trying to make up what it's lost 8O
