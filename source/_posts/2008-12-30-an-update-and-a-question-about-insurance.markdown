I've arrived safely back in the States with a minor case of jet lag, but none worse for the wear. Look for some updated photos here or on Flickr in the near future.

Meanwhile, I realize that an additional complication of graduating means that i need health insurance (since I'm no longer a dependent under my dad's insurance plan). Has anybody had experience purchasing insurance post-graduation? Some unique things about my situation:



	
  * I only need insurance from January till March (3 months). I start work mid-March, so I'll be covered by a company plan then.

	
  * I'd like my insurance to cover: 1) my monthly asthma prescription (Asmanex) and 2) travel shots/medication (various shots, malaria pills, etc).

	
  * The biggest risk I'm going to be taking is a trip to Botswana in February (more on that later). Should I be looking for a health plan that has additional travel risk coverage?


I'd really love your input, if you've any experience. Thanks!
