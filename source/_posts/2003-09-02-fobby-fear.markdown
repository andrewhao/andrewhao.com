sometimes my mom will ask me a question and then i'll answer in chinese just cuz i try to force myself to answer that way.. then she doesnt get it and repeats the question. and i, thinking that what i've said is right, stubbornly repeat the same chinese phrase and we go on and on until i give up and just answer in english. and then i leave, wondering if what i've said was actually right or if my mom's in the back snickering at my butchering of chinese.

yeah. that stinks.

and also when i go to pearl tea places and try to order in chinese but can't get the courage to do so (cuz they either won't understand me or will die laughing) so i just say what the heck.. i'll take the easy way out and order in english. then a huge sense of shame comes over me and lectures me on my loss of chinese culture.

(pan across, andrew walking up to counter)
me: umm... (long pause)
guy behind counter: (waits expectantly)
me: uhhh (pretends to scan the menu and tries to remember what 12 years of failed chinese education couldn't)
guy behind counter: (waits, a little less expectantly)
me: i'll have the strawberry pearl milk tea
(huge sense of shame comes over and lectures on the loss of chinese culture)
guy: (dreamlike tone, lots of reverb) you should have a huge sense of shame because of your loss of chinese culture
(fade out)

so you see? i'm losing my connection to half of the people i know. i'm in danger of being socially inept (actually i already am). and talking to my very own grandmother (bless her heart) on the phone is already an embarrassing task. this is bad. yes, i'm thinking college classes later on.

yikes.
