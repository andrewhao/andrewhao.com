last night i tagged along with jeremy to join some IV folk that we had never met and never seen at a josh groban concert. jeremy called me up and invited me to go.

my first thought: "who's josh groban?"
and the second: "what better things do i have to do tonight?"

so it was. and surprisingly it was good. the concert was too. i accidentally met lisa chu and a bunch of CCC folk on the way out. and then we got to shoreline, the IV folk happened to include justin hong from CCIC-SV. i felt right at home.

turns out that my floor i'm living on right now was legendary, apparently=) last year it consisted of a star studded cast that included tony xu and lisa chu. and a whole bunch of other people that i met but i can't remember their names.

ever get the feeling that God sets you up perfectly with just the right people? that's awesome. understandably.
