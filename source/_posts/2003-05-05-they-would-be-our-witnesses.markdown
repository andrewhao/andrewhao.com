There, in the summer heat, time seemed to stand still.

It was one of those days; those idyllic lazy Friday afternoons that drag on forever. Nuclear blast or none, time did not notice, continuing its slow and steady march towards the evening.

It was to be an evening that would not happen. Humankind, slowly but surely progressing for the last 10,000 years found itself staring at the beginning of the end. For several thousand years, civilization had been building itself up, always advancing, always moving. We defied the laws of the Universe, that all matter seeks to achieve a state of higher disorder. We laughed at those laws, thinking they did not apply to us. Civilization built for itself castles in the sand: our advancements furthered our own belief that we were the cosmic exception.

And now in a twist of cruel fate, the Universe was exacting its revenge. Quite ironic, I thought to myself. Had we been asking for this?

I stepped outside, feeling the warm ocean breeze whip around my body. Kicking off my shoes, I stepped into the sand and walked toward the ocean. My memories stirred, unwillingly woken from their customary slumber. In bits and pieces, they fluttered about my mind. I remembered the strangest little anecdotes: dropping my ice cream cone and crying my little 7-year old head off at the Fourth of July picnic. Kicking leaves on a stately tree-lined avenue in the fall with the bright assortment of colors flittering about me. The face of my second-grade crush appeared, and suddenly I found myself wondering where she was, what she had become and whether she, too, was contemplating the very end.
No, this was not the end. This was more of a farewell, a goodbye to my time on this earth. It was a peaceful affair. I let a soft chuckle escape.

Stopping at the water???s edge, I wondered what would happen if I continued walking as far as possible, letting the water swallow me up. It didn???t seem so bad, and there really was no other place to go.

The sun began to set over the horizon and humankind realized its time was over. There seemed to be such a calm familiarity about it. No hysterics, just a peaceful understanding. A knowledge that yes, my time on earth was drawing to a close that better things for me were just beginning.

The waves rhythmically lapped at my toes. When I was gone, the ocean tides would still be there. When the last of the bombs had exploded, the earth would somehow keep on going. I knew they would.

Time stood still as the the stars overhead flashed a million knowing winks. They would be our witnesses.
