you know it's almost summer when you lie on your bed for extended periods of time dreading your homework, then when you start your homework all you can dream of is getting back onto your bed.
you know it's summer when the inside of your house is hotter than the outside (ok this is debatable). you know it's summer when you start writing really stupid inane blog posts like this.

oh man.. section leader hearings for me are tomorrow, and i'm slightly worried. i mean, it's a given that i'll mess up. it happens. i mean it _always_ happens. i dont think i've yet to hear of a person who's played a perfect hearing (there are exceptions =P) yeah.. scales, some other assorted exercises and sightreading.. no problem right? i hope so.. but given my history i have a feeling it will border on catastrophic.

SATIIs, schmSATtwos. blah. thats all i have to say.

i gotta finish up all my hw crud tonight.. tomo will be super busy. sl hearings, piano class, track banquet (wahoooo).. yes.. it will be one fun-filled tragically depressing day.

did i just say that?
