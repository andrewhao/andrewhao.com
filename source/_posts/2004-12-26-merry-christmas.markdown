Hope your Christmases are filled with family, friends and darn good cheer =)

Christmas here is pretty much just a commercial holiday. To boot, I've heard "The Twelve Days of Christmas" a little over twenty times piped through department store speakers. That makes 12 x 20 "A partridge in a pear tree"s.

There is a nightlife in Taipei. I'm just not awake for it.

Man, family's good but I'm still missing y'all.

I've got side projects with six million different ideas running through my head and no real progress on em.

Man, we're darn blessed. Sit for a couple minutes tonight and think about that.
