Mike calls me as I drive into Berkeley this morning.

"Hey, Andrew, it's Mike, I'm at Highland [hospital]. My heart give out last night, my arm start hurtin' and I had to go to the ER. They wanna admit me for a few days, but I'll get out though. They treat me like I'm dying or something, but I'm not gonna die. Anyways, go on ahead Drew, I'll see you in a bit."

With all these trips into and out from the hospital, it's easy to forget that Mike's condition is life-threatening. I whisper a silent prayer.
