yesterday i told my piano teacher that i was considering taking a 5 month break from lessons.. cuz ever since this year started, i just havent been able to find the **time **or **motivation **to continue practicing.

i guess she was slightly surprised, but it wasn't a total shock to her. she's been asking me these past couple of weeks how if i never practiced, why even bother taking piano?

so i answered that question.

she was.. reluctant to let me go. i mean, i'm dumping the previous seven months of preparation, dropping the CM test and just giving up. she told me that she still believed in me. problem is that... well... i don't even believe in myself. i've avoided the piano like the plague for reasons that sometimes i dont even comprehend. i had to tell her the truth. i cant continue doing something i dont believe in.

i already know what's going to happen. i'm going to regret. i'm going to regret ever taking a break. i'm going to see other people playing and realize that i've lost that gift, however temporary it may be. i'm going to miss creating music out of the ivory keys. i know.

but right now, that's not how it is to me. they say distance (absence?) makes the heart grow fonder. so let it happen.

i'll be waiting.
