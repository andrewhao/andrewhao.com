I think Grace is jackhammering into my creaky l'il religious heart right now. A simple word from Romans is tearing me apart like it hasn't before.

10 For with the heart one believes and is justified,

11 For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”

12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek;

13 For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”

_Romans 10:8-13_


And the crux of the matter is that Jesus' grace is freely accessible, demonstrating his love for us ("while we were sinners Christ died for us"). I don't earn it. I simply believe. It's been done, already, for two-thousand years. It's not my initiative, it's his.

I've been oblivious--comatose, maybe--to this scandalous truth. I'm still out there chasing my own reality, trying to shape my future with my own two hands. Though exhilirating, it's getting tiring.

And here's the Grace and glory of it all: I am simply his son. Nothing to prove. Adopted into the family, commissioned with a call. Nobody to compare myself against; nothing to brag about. To know that I am in Christ is enough to redirect my ambition, calm my nervous anxieties and free me to run.

My heart's still creaky and old, but there are signs of life.
