my ego took a mashing today when kevin sun burned the heck out of me in track running a 600m. ah who knows.. i guess i'm still out of shape? i've always joked around about how i always place somewhere close to the back of the pack in track, yet secretly i've always prided myself on being able to run faster than my teammates. i guess that's all about to change.. i guess i need to accept the fact that i'm not always gonna be at the top and i need to keep doing my best. yeah.. tough beans to swallow, but i'm learnin..

worship practice today was pretty loud cuz the system was cranked up pretty high.. i hope we didnt disturb anybody or anything (whoops). yeah.. for a time something didnt feel right and i guess the practice was falling apart (partly my fault too) when we realized we forgot to pray. arghs.. that would explain it  :)  but yeah.. channing popped tammy's guitar peg and it went flying and now nobody can find it. not tonight, anyhow. heh heh..

yeah.. loads of hw and (as usual) i have not finished it yet. if ever, at all. yes, this is a bad habit, but anyways gonna go devos then get a-crackin' on the books.
