oh goodness, i'm getting old. xangasurfing made me realize that today, as i realized the people whose xangas i was reading were born in what? 1989? 1990? **that's my youngest sister's age.** and they're talking about drama and clothes and makeup and stuff that teens talk and twitter about.. oh man. has time gone by this fast? i'm approaching 18 pretty darn soon. that means official adulthood, the Selective Service, voting and college.

as chris suen said yesterday, "it doesnt get better than second semester senior year. after that, life just gets tougher." hm.

but ya.. chris, alex choy, jameson and i went down to eli thomas at oakridge yesterday.. had a fun time overwhelming the sales staff ahahaha. they'll look good, no doubt.

God's teaching me to live radically.. in the strangest ways i guess. sometimes i'll be passing some person on campus and i'll feel a gentle nudge to pray for them over something totally random that God pops into my mind. the other day at lunch i couldn't shake the feeling that i needed to sit next to this one guy alone at the corner at the quad. so i did.. the kid's name was darren. haha it might've been kinda awkward, having some foolio just walk up to you and strike up conversation. but darren seems like a pretty cool guy, freshman, a wrestler, likes mario kart double dash (a game i simply must play before i die) and was ditched by his friends at lunch. hope to meet him sometime else. morning worship is like.. God show us Your glory on campus, even if it means we look like fools. haha and we probably do, but it's all good. gonna praise You from the quad, simply cuz You deserve it  :)

speaking of praise, the youth groups at 5th Home of Christ and Chinese Church in Christ are holding a joint praise night at CCIC this friday from 7:15-10:00! check it out:
