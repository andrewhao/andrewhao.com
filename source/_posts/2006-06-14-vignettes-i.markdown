We sit in the van breathing the same air, together in the seven-seater as a family for the first time in many years. "It's so weird," my sister insists, "it's so weird, graduating." Four hundred families had celebrated her graduating class that afternoon.

My dad looks over the driver's seat, "How does it feel?"

"It's a weird feeling," she continues. "Like..." The night envelopes her thoughts.

My dad finishes it for her. "It's like you've lost something."

She thinks for a bit, hesitating, bating her breath, holding her words. Then finally: "Yeah. Like I lost something."
