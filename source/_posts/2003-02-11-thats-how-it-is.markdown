been really struggling to keep afloat amidst all that's getting thrown at me and fighting off this sickness at the same time. i don't ask for pity guys.. but i do ask for some prayer backup =D

lately i've been feeling kind of isolated.. sort of removed from people due to so many different things. all i can say is that i still do care.. but it's just currently too tough to juggle that right now. i'm sorry..

but on a happier note.. the AMC12 math competition's tomorrow.. oh wait.. nevermind. gotta get to school about 7:20ish and i'm in some deep doodoo if i dont finish my work.

the clock's struck 12. hang in there, dude.
