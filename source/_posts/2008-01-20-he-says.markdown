So freshman year I met this girl, Sarah. She was pretty cool, if a little quirky. I liked that. She was way in love with God. I liked that. We had shared interests and passions. Unsurprisingly, we became fast friends.

Time passed. Our friends thought we would get together that year. We weren't. Sophomore and junior years passed. We kept in touch with each other as friends. But Sarah, I figured, wasn't very interested in me. Which was okay because I was just fine with our friendship.

Senior year rolls around and wow, I start developing feelings for this amazing friend of mine. This girl is beautiful and I'm noticing it now more than ever.

We have our theories why we didn't get together in that period of time. I think it was timing. There was a right time for our feelings to unfold. There was a right time for maturity to develop. There was a right time for us each to wrestle with our identities and fears and insecurities with Dad. There was a right time for our friendship to develop ahead of anything else.

Now's the time. Oh man, I can't describe to you how hopeful and scared and downright excited I am. [Now I'll let her tell her side of the story...](http://www.xanga.com/plusonederful)
