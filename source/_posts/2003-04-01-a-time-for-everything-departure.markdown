so in calc, francine diana edith and i were talking about how it's almost the time for the seniors to leave.. shoot it's april already guys  :!:  that leaves two-ish months before graduation and after that, nobody's really too sure..  :cry:

francine's off to annapolis two weeks after school for boot camp.. wow that girl.. i'm seriously proud of her. i mean.. who would've thought of the naval academy? that's so cool.. doing something so different to approach her dream (astronaut?).

edith's considering summer classes.. maybe leaving early to take a summer session? whatever it is.. seniors.. i know that we're all gonna miss yall.

i'm happy for those of you who've spent months and maybe even years waiting for acceptance into your dream college. congrats to tammy on wellesley, judy for UCSD bioE/UCB molecE and the CHAN MAN for STANFORD BABY! seriuosly you guys have no idea how happy i was for you guys when i heard the news. awesome.

honestly i never really felt a strong connection with the senior class (at school or at yg or wherever) until this year.. i've grown up with a lot of you guys and seeing you guys go and start your own lives is really going to hurt.

and i know so many people are going through tough times of decision.. and i'm praying for you guys. no matter how scary it is.. please know that.

man.. the times they are a-changing and soon enough 04, it's our turn. that's life i guess.
