well.. this has officially screwed up my sleep schedule.

okay.. so i napped 3 hrs in the afternoon. so that's cheating.

one of these days over winter break i'm gonna spend an entire day just devoted to sleeping. that sounds good.

time to go take a shower. i wonder if i'll survive mr. battaglia. i get drowsy just thinking about it.

i'm out.
