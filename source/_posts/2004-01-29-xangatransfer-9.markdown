yeah yeah yeah, i sprained my ankle a day ago as per tradition (it's not a season until andrew's committed bodily harm to himself =)  i'm going to be limping around school for the next couple of days, but its not too bad. it'll heal and i'll be on my feet again.. literally.

my mom's getting used to these injuries. i limped in the house, she took one look at it and asked "do you need to see a doctor?" to which i replied of course not, and she just shrugged and got me some ice. ah, thanks mom for not freaking out.

seven+ hours of sleep each day, and i feel so good. this is the way it should be =) it's at least double of last year's sleep average, which leads me to believe that surviving last year was a miracle in itself.
