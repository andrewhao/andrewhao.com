my visit to the dentist today was one only in nightmares. after waiting in the waiting room for about half an hour, i get taken to a sticky vinyl seat where my poor teeth and gums get poked and prodded by sharp instruments and bathed in strange chemicals. worst part is when the dentist went at my teeth with what can best be described as a needle/hook, Captain Hook-style and began mercilessly scraping out gunk whilst ignoring my pained whimpers and facial expressions.

no, that was the bearable part. the PG-13 part. the horror comes when my gums start bleeding like, well, some horror movie. i'm gonna stop describing it there. and there's all this throbbing in my mouth and to top it off, many, many, many darned cavities are found.

"see you tomorrow!" chirps the receptionist. tomorrow i get my teeth drilled and cavities filled. i would normally find it funny that my previous sentence rhymed. but now, i am somber. i am sad. i am scared. i am darn stupid for not flossing and brushing and mouthwashing like a good responsible kid should, all the time.

i shoot her a helpless glance. rats.

later in the afternoon, gums still throbbing, i went to fry's, bought stuff then realized that my debit card was maxed out. bummer.

then right after that i exchanged a defective TV tuner card in my computer for, guess what, another defective TV tuner card. double bummer.

Call prayer meeting tonight was pretty good. i think it's awesome how you seem to come across just the right passages when you're praying. good stuff.
