A question:  
  
Does anybody know where I can buy [Linotype](http://www.linotype.com/) fonts on the cheap (say, a Helvetica or a Futura)? Or if I can't quite shell out the money for those; anybody have any suggestions for their close cousins (art/graf students, clue me in!)  
  
An unrelated thought:  
  
The structural format of a blog (particularly as posts are presented chronologically & serially) has drastic implications on content. This format encourages authors to write posts that are either completely self-contained or closely related to chronologically similar posts. How will a reader make the links or connections to chronologically separated posts with similar content? Folksonomies (tagging) and categories take a mild step to solve this, but leave the reader to dig to make those connections. I wonder if anybody's pioneered anything new regarding blog structure and format--maybe some new data visualization stuff, maybe following the lead of newspaper formats. It's an interesting thought (to me, and probably only me :D).
