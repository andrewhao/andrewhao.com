If there's one thing I've learned this year, it's that nearly everything escapes categorization. Everything I've come across has failed to fit in my neat & trim boxes. Far less things are solid black and solid white than I'd like to admit. It's not that there are mixed shades of grey, but as I walk closer I find speckles of black and white.

I've always been somewhat of a chameleon, making friends with all sides of every debate. These friends of mine, these high-minded philosophies and world-views from around the globe have been swapped around every once in awhile. I always thought of it as a way of achieving balance; never allowing myself to linger about in one place lest I become too "closed-minded" or let myself be "blind" to the possibilities of other perspectives. So I'd put myself in my friends' shoes, then switch once, twice, and once again.

_In the areas of: _politics & Christology & missiology & hermeneutics & _Truth?_ & messed up people _a.k.a. me_ & frenemies (haha) & sin & Grace & redemption & justice & the Divine

It's a whole lot of hopscotching in a whole lot of arenas. I'm not taking a position on any of these things, because I see the value in every position. It's some twisted kind of dance. I'm tired of it.

I think I'm being unintelligible to everybody but myself here (and even that's debatable). But essentially, I think this homelessness I'm experiencing is a result of 1) reckless deconstruction 2) reading too wide and too shallow and 3) some personal, irrational aversion to forming convictions and using my voice.

I'll try to elaborate on this more in later posts, but tonight I'm trying to articulate a certain frustration.


> _But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind._

James 1:5-6 (NASB)
