It's only week 2, but I already have my list.


#### **You shouldn't be a Regen intern:
**





	
  * Guaranteed conflicts with people.

	
  * Janitorial work involving urine, mildew, and mold.

	
  * Always being available can take its toll on you.

	
  * Someone always eats your food in the fridge.

	
  * Boundary-setting is uncomfortable.

	
  * Saturday chores are long and hard.

	
  * There's a stray cat we can't get out of the basement showers.




#### **You should be a Regen intern:
**





	
  * Living and serving with bros, within the Oakland community.

	
  * Learning how limited you are and how twisted your intentions truly are... and how those things are redeemed by Jesus.

	
  * Circuit training and taco truck Tuesdays. In-n-Out runs too.

	
  * Doing hard things is the only way to grow. For me, that's learning to set boundaries and being "the bad guy".

	
  * Tim Keller sermons.

	
  * Loving the local church. Its people are quirky, a little strange, yet amazing.

	
  * Eating someone else's food in the fridge.

	
  * Weeping at how merciful, gracious and Good our God is.
