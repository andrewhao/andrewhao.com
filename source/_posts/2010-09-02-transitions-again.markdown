This Tuesday was my last day at Riverbed. I've moved onto a yearlong ministry internship at [Regeneration](regenerationweb.com), and moved in across the street from the church in Oakland. I'm starting to see how this is shaping up to be an urban monastic existence, as Justin put it. It's funny, because I used to think that being an engineer meant working in a cube all by your lonesome, but even then I was surrounded by people. Now I'm not sure how to deal with all this solitude (!).

I'll post more about this in detail, but I realize that this season of study, service and introspection is going to be more difficult (and hopefully, more rewarding) than expected. I'm excited to see how God shows up.

There may be a new blog coming soon. Stay tuned!
