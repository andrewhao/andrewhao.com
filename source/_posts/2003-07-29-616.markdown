i came back ready to fly  
only to have burdens dumped back on my shoulders  
and i dont ask for pity.. i dont deserve any.




a lifeline is all she needs  
but she's still trapped beneath the surface  
beneath the weight of the world  
an opportunity is all she needs  
but she watches them stolen  
one by precious one  
a respite is all she needs  
but it resides in her system  
eating her from the inside out  
a goal is all she needs  
but they become meaningless  
and blow away - chaff in the wind.  
  
a smile is all she needs
