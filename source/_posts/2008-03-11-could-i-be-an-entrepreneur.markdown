This semester I'm taking IEOR 190A - Engineering Entrepreneurship. We are made up of a bunch of business types and engineering types and business-engineering types who come together to figure out how to start a business in the tech sphere.

Here's how I'd explain this class: come up with a business plan for a company in semester, then execute it. At the end of the semester, you should have the tools to _actually do it_. Yow!

The thought of (or idea of) entrepreneurship is really alluring. I think it's the _idea of creating_ something where there was nothing, starting and sustaining a great idea or product that could change the world (or something slightly less schnazzy, sure) seems so rewarding.

Of course,  in class we only hear from the smiling guest lecturers who navigated shaky start-ups through uncertain waters and nailed crucial business decisions to accelerate earnings by 1000% margins. We always hear about the mythical serial entrepreneur, the quintessential American man or woman who by a mix of cunning insight, dogged perseverance and arbitrary market whims (e.g. sheer luck), see their dreams become reality.

We don't always hear from the entrepreneur whose family life is strained because he always travels or stays late in the office. We don't always hear from the men and women who burn through money on dud after dud.

I worked with my friend Dave at FAQLY, his social networking startup two years ago my sophomore year. Dave was way passionate about the network and its potential. I knew it took a toll on him. Most of his waking hours were spent dreaming (I like to think) of ideas. He didn't sleep much.  He had to play many roles, from visionary to manager to chauffeur (haha, hi Dave!).

Anyways, my point was that even though there was a high potential for failure and a _ridiculously_ demanding workload, Dave persevered through it all. Two years later, Dave's working on another project now (have you heard of [gOS](http://www.thinkgos.com)?). And I talk to him occasionally and he tells me that he's still not sleeping much. I know he's just as passionate.

I'm starting to suspect that the draw to start a company is less about the idea than it is about the _feeling_ of creating. It's elusive and fleeting but when you catch it, you're energized to try some more.

Hsiu-Fan and I are still a bit hesitant to call [Wejoinin](http://wejoinin.com) anything more than a pet project. Could it be anything more? Who knows. We're treading carefully on that idea as we carefully calibrate our expectations. It's been kind of cool as I start applying what I learn from IEOR 190A to Wejoinin.

One thing's for sure, though. I'm in it for love of the game. I'm there because I feel alive when I create. Whether that means I'm behind the terminal or on the field or whatever remains to be seen.
