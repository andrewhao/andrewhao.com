Remember your high school dances? The ones where you had to take a date to? Remember how painful it would be getting and asking a date - and the associated emotions of excitement and fear mixed in with teenage hormones?

Yeah, I know you do.

Remember being a complete, total flaming JERK when it came to dates? Yeah, Andrew, you do. Flashback to the sadies dance last year. She asked you, even got the flowers and the photo and asked in a cute way. AND YOU HAD TO TOTALLY DESTROY IT by mumbling some weak excuse about how you weren't going and got outta that awkward moment. You weren't originally gonna go, but could you have said something a _little_ more affirming and touching and maybe slightly humorous instead of that lame excuse of an excuse? Could you have at least taken her feelings and her effort into account? And can this entry contain any more rhetorical questions?

Long story short, lately I've been going through episodes of Guilt on Time Delay.
