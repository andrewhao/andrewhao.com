going off to sleep really soon.. cuz i've gotta wake up at 5:30 to send my parents off to the airport.

these past few days have been pretty hectic. yesterday the mexico team went to cahalan park in almaden just to do some open air outreach ministry. it was pretty cool to just meet and talk with people, play with kids and really try to demonstrate what the gospel is all about  :)

link crew training is now finished and we are ready. last year i felt really ineffectual.. like i didnt do enough to make a real difference in my freshmen's lives. i knew who they were but we never actually talked outside after orientation. this year i hope it can be a little different.. some of the kids in my group are in marching band so that should be an opportunity to get to know em better. bah.. link crew is only effective if you take the time and energy to connect with them and that's honestly just hard to come up with.

frosh band camp started up today and wow.. i am **impressed** with the freshmen for just learning so fast and so well. too early to say just how skilled they are but they've got potential  8O  i'm pooped now.. five hours on the field, my feet burn and my head's sore and we're only one day in. hang in there.

i've finished reading **catch-22** and i don't think i've ever been so caught up and so darn **frustrated** with some characters in the book. i think joseph heller was aiming to make some of the antagonists annoying, but GOODNESS. i was ready to scream at the people in the book. i mean that in a good way, mind you.. that's how you know good writing: when the reader no longer distinguishes fiction from reality.

i've said enough.. i've gotta wake up in four and a half hours from right now so its time to hit the hay.
