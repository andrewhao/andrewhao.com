so today was gonna turn out to be a nice, boringly normal summer day.

sometime mid-afternoon i told my mom i'd be out to get a haircut. i grabbed the keys and my wallet and jumped in the car.

normally i'm a real cautious (relatively speaking) driver. but recently, i've been noticing myself getting into some really bad habits. like changing CDs while driving or eating a burger or something like that. you know, that kind of stuff they warn you about in driver's school. no big deal, i thought.

so i'm driving a few mph over the speed limit and take a left turn onto prospect boulevard from miller ave. in my rearview mirror (that i thankfully still check) i could see a motorcycle and a late model ford explorer pull in behind me.

about a quarter mile down the road, i pass a nice looking honda civic si that i recognize from the lynbrook parking lot. it's in the middle turning lane (apparently about to cross the street or something).

three seconds pass. and then i hear the sound of crushing metal. you know how in the movies they make the car accidents sound like freight train pileups? you know BAMKAPOWSCREEEECH that sort of stuff? well that's not true. it was more like.. i dunno. it was more like a.. _ker-crunch_. or something like that. like the sound of a garbage can hitting the floor. whatever that sounds like.

i quickly glanced into my rearview mirror and i immediately knew it was bad. the explorer was doing pirohuettes in the middle of the road, its entire front end totalled. and the civic was limping down the road onto oncoming traffic, its entire left side ruined, basically...

and you know what, if i'd been driving about 20 feet behind where i was, that woulda been me.

and that really scared me.

i was in the barbershop waiting my turn when i heard the sound of sirens in the distance and saw an ambulance making its way down the road toward the accident scene. and thats when i started feeling guilty.

should i have stopped and helped out? oh man.. i'd want people helping me out if i got into something major like that. i really hope nobody was seriously hurt in that accident.. what if that were me? how badly hurt would i have been?

see, i believe that God's protection was on me today. and you know what, everything else just pales in comparison. why worry about grades and material things? why should you care how you look when you could be taken outta this world in a split second?

so yeah.. who said that summer had to be boring? maybe not in this way. so guys, dont ever take life for granted. thats what i learned today. dont ever think that what you have will last forever.

got it? good.
