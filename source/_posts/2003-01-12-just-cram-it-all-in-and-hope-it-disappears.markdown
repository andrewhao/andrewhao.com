i dont know why this happens.. but i always end up staying late doing chem. and yesterday night, you can guess what i was doing.

this made my day (early morning):

S u K i yaki 27 (4:09:10 AM): andrew i voted with myself
S u K i yaki 27 (4:09:14 AM): and decided you should go to sleep

ahahhaa that's **timeless.**
hey isnt that crazy? check the time. that's right guys. 4AM. a few certain chem students were up late having fun. **lots of fun.**

anyways yesterday i finished the agape shirt redesign. we're gonna start advertising to the club at the next meeting. saw klarissa lee with the mountain view fish club sweatshirts - they are SO COOL. but anyways.

had a lil chem study with some of the guys today.. quite interesting. hahaha it basically went like this.

**someone** asks a question.
**benjy:** "____? oh that's blahblahblahlbhablahi'mtoofreakingsmartforyoumeremortals"
**us: **"ohhhhhhhhh"
**someone: **"okay, next question on the sheet"
**charles: **"OKAYYY this is dumb.. skip the next seventeen questions cuz we KNOW this stuff already."
**taimur: **"waiiiiit someone explain ______ to me!"
**me: **"yea i didnt get ________ either."
**benjy: **"uhh, that was 3 questions ago"
**scott: **"i'll chem your tree! HAHHAHAHA"
**me:** "HAHHAHAHHAHHAA ROFL"
**everybody else: **(stares in silence)
**scott and me**: "err yeah."

or something like that.

but yes... finals studying is going better than i thought. as in: i've been studying.

the fact that this has happened is evident of my screwedness in several classes. namely, all of them. but its all good. study hard, do my best and no regrets. definitely none.

You drive an Integra Type R. You are savy, stylish, and down  
to earth. Although sometimes on a budget, you are ahead of  
most cars in performance and handling, and you are the  
envy of most Civic drivers.
