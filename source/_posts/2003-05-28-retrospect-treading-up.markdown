the track banquet at hank's house was great as usual.. had a lot of fun and especially some good barbecue.

oh man.. i cannot pass up good food and a lot of sun. emphasis on the good food. a lot of it. yeah okay so in the past week i've probably put on pounds and pounds and flabbed myself up a bit.. which means i'm going to embark on **andrew's magic flab loss plan!** how does it work? good question. dr. atkins, where are you...?

i tried to clean my room today but to no avail.. i could barely notice the difference before and after (which goes to prove what a mess it really is). yeah my bed hasnt been made in a month or two.. i havent seen sections of the ground for half a year and there's some carpet stains that.. wait a minute how did those get there?  8O

i think a large part of the reason i'm always feeling stressed is because i start a ton of projects but never finish them.. so they kind of lie there on the back burner smoldering away while i run around with always something bothering me. i think i'm gonna start to get some closure to these miscellaneous endeavours of mine. i think that would work.

and currently i'm pretty spaced out, if the tone of this blog hasnt told you already. you know.. a half-conscious daze where you just kind of watch your words pass onto the screen with no connection of what in the world you are writingnarf pink wart fart bragaal
