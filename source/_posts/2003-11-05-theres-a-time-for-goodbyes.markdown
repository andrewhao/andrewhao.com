seems lately that it's been a time of last times and goodbyes. especially this week, it's been chock full of them. the last pasta feed, the last cross country meet, the last mb rehearsal, the last mb competition.

something about 'last' that makes me want to trick myself into believing that there'll still be more, that they'll still be coming. but heck, once this week's over with, that's a huge chunk of my time and my life gone.

it's finished. four years straight and it's gone. wow. i think that's how i can best describe my emotion. it's not really misty nostalgic yet.. but just a sad realization that we're getting close to the end guys.

okay it's not even december. so sue me. but hey let's squeeze it for what it's worth guys.

**lodi was a huge pendulum of emotions** as i can testify. we marched beautifully. the judges apparently didn't catch on. goodness, we placed last in our class (that's nothing to be proud of), but the painful part is **KNOWING** that you were denied recognition.

winning isn't everything: tell me if you believe that or not. i believe it's how you march, the **strength and pride **you march with that determines your experience. so heck guys, one more. napa's our last chance to prove we're so much better. get out there and blow em away.

**so the last cross country meet i'll ever run** was at crystal springs again.. probably my ninth time running it. perfect conditions: no rain, but a nicely packed course. chilly weather but not too biting. it was set.

i pushed the race hard, perhaps not as hard as i know i'm capable of toward the end. i dunno, seems as if my will's so weak against my body nowadays. i couldn't take on extra pain, so i didn't improve nearly as much as i did.

18:38. it flaunts me, flies in my face. let's me know it's good, but not good enough.

but something tells me to let go.. i've done my best (have i?) and hey.. just let it go.

it's over now. DAH.

big props to christina liao and eugene berson for running themselves out (literally). eugene recovered faster than he did in hawaii, christina, well, let's say we were really worried for her. she's allright now though.

ah, cross country. it's gone now. guys aren't going CCS (no use with the what ifs) and the girls are. big ups and congrats!

rambled again, but that's what i need to do every now and then.
