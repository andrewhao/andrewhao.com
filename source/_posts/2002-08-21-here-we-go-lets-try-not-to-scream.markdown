wow.. been ignoring the blog for a (relatively) long period of time. anyways been really busy these last few days. full band camp is going on this whole week and man.. we're really working pretty hard. there's actually a whole different vibe in band this year. man.. we're HARDCORE guys  8O  hahaha aiyo.. totally a big change from slackerville last year.

but i think its really cool.. i mean we've got our work cut out for us (cuz the drill is killer tough). but as long as people care about band and as long as they work hard we're gonna ROCK the competition.

clarinets had dinner at carrow's tonight. it actually went better than i thought. we got to know each other a whole lot better and had a lotta fun. _fun_, defined as figuring out a $217.91 tab + tax. hahaha.. jay and jasper (graduated senior clarinets) and their respective girlfriends came and visited us in the middle. it kinda turned awkward when they walked in... for several reasons. yeah. but still i thought that was a pretty fun thing to do and a step towards sectional unity! everybody say ooooooooooo...

this entire week we've been painting the backdrop over at amber's house. man.. i should've been wearing dirtier clothing (you know what i mean) cuz i've got new paint spots on some nice white shorts. aw. still.. if you're reading this, you have no excuse NOT to go  :)

i think i need a cell phone - i didnt tell my mom where i was all last night (HC backdrop, link crew prep) and i guess she was worrying about me. er.. doh.

car's low on gas. now i'm shifting into neutral on straight roads and seeing how far i can roll before needing to upshift and accelerate again. cheap asians, unite!

school, what's that?  :(  i'm keeping that as far away from me as possible. sorry. no, i dont want to discuss how we're gonna die. cuz i know we will. thats horrible.

anyways, http://www.lhsclass2004.com is now open! well until eugene berson sends out an email. i really hope this site can succeed - mainly in the area of the forums. we need a huge user community going in spite of junior year stress. so i'm gonna need some help (any junior that's reading this, SIGN UP! NOW! CUZ MOMMA SAID SO!)

off to return library books and fill up the car again. tomo will be bandcampy and backdroppy too.
