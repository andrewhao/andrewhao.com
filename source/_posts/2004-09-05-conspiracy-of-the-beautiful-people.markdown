i went to valley fair yesterday to go shopping, and i don't know if you can identify with this but i felt really, really out of place.

so in all the hip clothing stores, incredibly good-looking sales reps call out to you as soon as you enter (just as if they knew you). they have glossy photos plastered over the walls of the type of person you wish you were, suntanned chiseled abs and all, smiling and laughing with a girl hanging off each arm and (most importantly) clothes that are never out of style. branded, expensive clothes that are never ever out of style.

and you enter this magical land of the incredibly good-looking and you realize that each shopper rivals those in the posters (does anybody else get the feeling that some people dress up just to go to the mall?) and they would feel just at home if they stepped into the photos.

and maybe somehow over the bass-heavy soundtrack ??? you get the itching feeling that there's this big sign on your forehead that broadcasts to the world: DOES NOT BELONG. does not belong to this space-time warp of fashionistas and hunks and supermodels. you feel a little uncomfortable, even a little fake in the dressing rooms sporting the sandblasted jeans, the turned up collar or the vintage-fit knit shirt. not as advertised per the glossy photos, ten wide by seven feet tall.
