Being assertive is really unnatural for me. Eric called me out on this the other day:

"Does anybody want to drive?" vs. "I'm really tired because I've driven a lot today. Can somebody else drive for us?"

It never even CROSSED my mind that I could say "Hey, I'm tired and I don't want to do this." Passive-aggressive kids can be pretty messed up. But at least I'm figuring this out now rather than later. Shout-out to Eric for calling it out.Â There's hope!
