okay.. so i found out a few days ago that i'd made it to clarinet co-section leader next year.

first thought: awwright!!
second thought: oh NO..

haha.. you see.. im pretty scared about the whole thing. how i'm supposed to be a (quote-unquote) leader and all that.. how i'm supposed to "regulate".

arent leaders supposed to be.. you know.. **confident?**

haha.. channing and i'll work something out. i hope.

took another nap this afternoon.. it felt real good.. but right now at 1AM it doesnt feel so good. i'll never learn.

why does learning a new piano piece take so long? why is it so tedious? why can't i play the freaking thing right? aghhhhh its so frustrating... somebody please sympathize. or maybe it's just me and my slightly retarded playing ability. sigh..

no more juice left in the fridge, it's back to drinking milk.. and perpetually having a sour taste in my mouth.
