Man, I am so calloused.

These past few weeks have been sorrowful ones for humanity. Cyclones, earthquakes, bombings, and the like.

I am having a hard time _feeling_. My head knows these catastrophes are tragic and the need to move and seek help are dire and swift, but my heart has a hard time noticing.

Wake me up from American complacency. Bring me to my knees in prayer. Move my hands to help.
