i've gotta admit.. i have a lot of fun talking to people in the early morning when we're all stressed out and rushing and worrying. ah.. its hilarious now that i look back on it.. kindasorta

anyways the 30-Hour Famine starts today at 8AM (that's in 3 hours).. for those of you who dont know what this is, my youth group is going to fast (go w/o food) for 30 hours to help raise money for World Vision. this money goes to help buy food, housing, education, clean water and the like for underpriviliged people in Third World countries. if you could sponsor anybody for any amount of money (even a buck or two is fine).. that'd mean a lot.

anyways, i should get some sleep if i'm expecting anything resembling consciousness tomorrow. i think i'm gonna bring my pillow to school.
