[![Channing Ave, 11PM.](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2121/2072718597_7c8ecd7802.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/2072718597/)

I'm awakened in the morning by a phone call -- It's Mr. Smith, and his car needs a jump. The evening before we had spotted him in the parking lot; he was still seated in his parked car, eyes closed in rapt concentration or heavy sleep, we couldn't tell.

"It's jazz," he explains later. He listens to the jazz giants in his car as is his tradition upon returning home from church. He is aging, his frame is small and hunched, he is becoming forgetful. His car is often parked askew between the lot lines, drifting at odd angles, curious flotsam in an asphalt sea.

Years ago, Miles, John and Dizzy serenade Mr. and Mrs. Smith as they sit together in the driver and passenger seats, holding hands all the way back from church on 98th Ave. There they float and unwind, recounting the events of that evening's ministry. I imagine she smiles at the way his pageboy hat carries at a rakish angle, the way he recites the benediction with the voice of a man much younger than his years. And now I imagine him still sitting in that parking lot, recounting his evening with her, murmuring and chuckling in a half-conscious reverie.

Kind of blue, Mr. Smith drifts to where his beloved still lives, who leans over to playfully adjust his bow tie, takes his wrinkled hands into hers and lets him feel her beating chest where the cancer has not yet gone. There he stays with her, hearing the music well into the morning when the instrument panel will dim, the frost will clamber onto the hood and the chill will irritate his throat and cause him to cough a couple of times. Slow, measured coughs. He turns over in his seat.

I run into the morning chill and see his car is running with the help of a friendly neighbor. "I'm going to get a new battery," he tells me, fumbling with the jumper cables. With bright, certain eyes he declares, "Tomorrow."
