Okay, let's start packing. I'm just sitting here in my room wondering _where the heck do I start?_ How much space do I have in my luggage, do I have my passport, [what's the weather like over there](http://www.wunderground.com/global/stations/68032.html)? Oh shoot, thunderstorms! Jacket, rain jacket, where is the jacket…




Passport, can't forget the passport. Do I need a travel power transformer? Soft suitcase or hard suitcase… I'm afraid the hard suitcase will crack. Or the soft suitcase will… let all our stuff get crushed. Meds! Oh, I've gotta start taking those malaria meds. Can't wait for the vivid dreams to kick in (I'll keep you posted if anything of that sort happens).




Last night my mom emailed me, asking me if I'd started packing yet. "Do it earlier, and you will be free from stress," she told me. Mom, I knew I should have listened to you!




Oh, before I resume all the craziness, please let us know if you'd like to be on our prayer update mailing list, or if you'd like to receive our prayer packet. You can do so by leaving a comment on this blog, or emailing/Facebooking/calling Sarah or myself.
