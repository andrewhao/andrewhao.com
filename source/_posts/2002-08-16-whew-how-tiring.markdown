link crew leader training today was pretty fun stuff. we just sorta went over.. all the activities we'd be doing and what not. 101 leaders this year.. thats pretty crazy. 440 incoming frosh alone. probably more than that will show up.

anyways.. judy wang and i paired up.. whew.. pity the freshmen that get us (kidding). the more ridiculous our costumes are for the tour.. the better. (maniacal laughing) actually this stuff is more involved than it seems. i have to dream up a "life story" (notice the quotations). yes.. time to get out the pencil and paper and dream up a real sob story.

went out to lunch with charles and tianqi and ended up seeing the mb crew (ahha) there too. i realized why the service at wendy's was so fast: cuz everything is precooked. oh well.. small price to pay.

marching with the frosh today was pretty great. they're really picking up the skills pretty quickly and all. they're gonna be awesome come band camp. well.. most of them. some kids just.. arent very coordinated. sigh.. that means i gotta work with them some more. headache.

its pretty amazing though. we have the respect of the freshmen. they get to band practice early like we tell them to, they yell freaking loud at our vocal command like we tell them to.. and they run to their spots (like we tell them to). its great.. no upperclassmen to corrupt their young minds. come monday though.. that could be a whole lot different  :(

i wonder if my smilies work?  8)  :)  :?

anyways.. im turning several shades darker. coppertone sport spray sunscreen does NOT work. i repeat.. does NOT work. SPF 30 is inadequate, SPF 45 is inadequate. some people TRY to tan. i try to get un-tanned.

gsgniNe: who stole my fritos? and where did they go?
Auto response from Nalandagon: charles chen  i ate it too late

its 12:50AM and all my convos just turned to the subject of food. yum.
