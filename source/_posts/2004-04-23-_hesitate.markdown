i signed myself into cal today. i think it was both relieving and at the same time, scary. when alex, chris, hua and i went up to visit it yesterday all i wanted was a confirmation that yes, college wouldn't be so scary.

thanks judy for letting us invade your dormroom and showing us around a little bit. thanks to emile and mike for letting us crash in your foothill pad, talking to tony and his roommates really helped out a lot too.

can i say something? i think i signed into cal because i excluded the other options. i was afraid that i might have liked LA or SD or USC a little better. what am i looking for in college, anyways? i think the word for it is family. i'm looking for family.  i've got this image, this feeling in my mind of what college should be like.. i can't exactly describe it to you right now. but it's warm, and it's fuzzy, and it's completely unrealistic.

i've associated this image with the "less prestigious" school.. particularly LA and SD. dang, if my grades weren't so high.. then the choice would have been easier (i can't believe i said that). i always assumed i'd find that family down in those colleges. aw man i dont know what i'm saying. basically, i went to berkeley yesterday and the people i met and saw weren't the type of people that fit my ideal. it's wrong, i know it, but i can't help but feel it.

then yesterday i got a DVD from USC talking about their scholarship in the Institute of Multimedia Literacy. i popped in that DVD and went _aw crap, that's what i wanna do._ straight up: media & design, that's my real passion at the moment. i'm afraid that i won't get a chance to pursue those passions at berkeley, because you just dont hear of that stuff there.

we were talking to emile yesterday and he was kind of kidding around about his (slightly low) grades at berkeley. i dont think he was kidding, now that i think about it. "emile was looking a little down" alex observed. "i think he's disillusioned" remarked chris. goodbye, warm fuzzy dreams. hello, academic slavery.

so basically a whole bunch of things came up in the past couple of days that made me pause and wish i'd thought things through further. sorry, these are my fears, my doubts and my regrets (?) at the moment. i'm hesitating right now. aw crud.

i hope that 12 months from now i can say that i've made the unequivocal right decision. but for now, it's just gotten fuzzier. i'm just praying real hard.. cuz my future's not my own. gotta realize that. God take me where you want me to go. if it's still not my ideal place, i'll still go. i've been looking for family, provide me a fellowship with Godly peers and role models.. i need that right now. and there's so much i wanna ask, but it'll come. in due time.
