_it's good to know that you fail sometimes_
number one gun - celebrate mistakes

i know it's just a game, i know it's just a simple scrimmage, just for fun, no biggie right? i think the problem with basketball is that i take too much pride in my (supposed) abilities.

that was pretty frustrating today.. i won't make any excuses for my gameplay because it was honestly just crap. i won't make excuses for the game either.. what is it about me and losing?

failure's pretty foreign to me. that's what's pumped up my pride so much. and to have it crash again reminded me that my abilities and my talents aren't my own.

reminds me of bball tryouts, frosh and soph year. every day i'd come back from tryouts, brooding about what i could have done better here, why i missed that certain layup, why i didn't make myself stand out more, what the other guys were thinking of me.

today i felt like i let down my team. you guys deserved better from me. gosh this entry sounds so depressing. i guess my point is that when i fail, i get reminded that i'm not as invincible as i made myself out to be. and that scares me. what do i have to prove? and who am i proving it to?

the answer to that is nothing, to nobody. take it easy, andrew. there's so much more than this.

/end melodramatic sequence

on an even more depressing note, we ran crazy workouts today in track. to fill you in, the weather's been going bonkers as of late. temperatures probably hovered in the 80s today (keep in mind it's march 8th or so.. still officially winter). so my goodness.. those laps around the track took so much out of me.

my ankle's making pretty brisk progress. praise God for that. i'm hoping that this season brings PRs.. just one just one would be nice =)
