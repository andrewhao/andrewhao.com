I was, at one time, a dreamer (this is topic for another entry). I lost it a couple years ago, when I found myself feeling around for it in the recesses of my life like a myopic man searching for his spectacles. I don't know what happened, exactly. Things got old. Things stayed the same. I got impatient. I got mad. And then declared it bunk. Reality, I said, was different. The things of Heaven and Earth were fundamentally the same. I felt some selfish victory declaring this, and to this day I wonder why.

It's burning again, this restlessness I thought I had filed away neatly under 'youthful naivete'. Big dreams don't die easy, I'm discovering. This feeling is akin to hearing the apex of a rock jam, the awe of watching a sleeping baby draw breaths from the cradle air, the stillness after a rain, dancing in the clamor of the joyful noise, being, simply being in the closeness of the One you love.

And the urge to draw near, to be filled, to be freed, to overflow, is rising again.
