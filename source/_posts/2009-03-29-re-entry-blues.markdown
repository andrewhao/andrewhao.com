The transition back home hasn't been easy. It's been hard to get used to the hustle-and-bustle of life here after coming back from such a pivotal life experience.

I don't want to forget Africa. I can't. I need to remember, I need to remember the simplicity of living. The endless skies. Friends to chill with when you come home to. Sarah living a couple hundred feet away. Waking up with a vibrant passion and singular purpose.

Here, things are different. If life in Africa was a comfortable stroll, life in the States is doing 90MPH on the freeway. I suppose I'm having lane-merge problems.

So it's time to do taxes. And it's time to start work. And don't forget to take care of the yard. Oh, friends aren't as accessible as they once were. And I still haven't put roots down in a church community. And your family's spread out across a couple of continents.

I feel like my mind and my heart are scattered over a million different people and places, and it's frustrating. I need to focus. I need to hear. In many ways, I still haven't felt like I've come back home--I'm somewhere between departing and arriving.
