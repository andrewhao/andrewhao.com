actually there isn't much news to update haha.. school as usual. that is to say.. still pretty bad. i keep sleeping at 3AM these days.. i dont really know why. sometimes its cuz i take naps midday and dont wake up early enough.. other times its cuz of mb or xc or something and i dont get home till late.

other times i'm just loaded with hw. but honestly.. the hw itself isnt too bad right now.

anyways.. i finished the xc shirt. coach said that we were probably only gonna use the front (cuz the design for the back was already decided on). but hey.. i'm not complaining.

the back: [back](http://gsgnine.arabiafish.com/img/preview_back.jpg)

early mb tomorrow.. i dont really like early rehearsals cuz (duh) we gotta get up so early.. but i guess i'm sorta hoping it'll fix a lot of our trouble spots on the show. on monday night we were rehearsing and i guess it seemed so sloppy. but by the end of the night we pulled it together. barely.

piano class tomorrow. gonna get chewed out again. i'm dreading it already..

got my xc sweats (nice) and uniform (over-revealing) today. I AM CROSS COUNTRY RUNNER. I BLIND YOU WITH MY SHORT SHORTS EXPOSING PASTY WHITE THIGHS. thank you.

i have a blister on my left heel from my new adidas running shoes i got on sunday. im debating whether to pop it or let it sit. but man.. its killing me when i run.

see you at the pole poster-making is this friday after school (probably in front of ASB office)! i'll try to swing by when i can. SYATP is officially 7:30-9:10AM on Wed Sept 18. so come by and check us out. i'm pretty excited about this  :)

anyways back to hw! i wasted 10 precious minutes of my life. gotta work 10 minutes faster now.
