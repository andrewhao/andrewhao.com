Do you ever worry about losing yourself in somebody else? That they would completely and fully engulf you in your every waking moment. That their words would become your words, their thoughts would become your own, their identity is transplanted into your own? Are you ever as missing as the empty pillow beside you; lonely as the morning absence of the one you say you love?

When your emptiness is their absence, and so you grip harder and squeeze tighter until your knuckles go white in a turbulent embrace; I'm talking about that feeling when you need to surface for some air but it's been _so long_?
