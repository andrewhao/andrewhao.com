so here's what happened with my roommate situation: mike zou, my roommate is now my ex-roommate. and no, i didn't fart too much at night or drive him crazy with strange mannerisms (well, maybe a little). our sleeping schedules were just too off. he'd get into bed at 12AM or so and put up with me, sheepishly typing as quietly as possible (trust me, it's an acquired skill). in any case, he's moved down the hall and my new roomie's this cool cantonese guy called anson. he's only recently been in the states for a couple of years and his english is already pretty darn good. we've started talking in chinese, and it's super humbling for me cuz, well, i was the perpetual chinese school class dunce :-_-: spose it's time for me to relearn some of my culture, even at the expense of dignity and those moments when your tongue gets stuck in the middle of a phrase and you feel doggone dumb.

floor 4 deutsch simply rocks. they're always out and about and talking in the halls, jamming on guitars, blasting natalie imbruglia (and/or TLC) from five rooms, helping each other with homework and the such. simply, we rock.

in unrelated news, a cs midterm was passed (rather painfully), homework was done, Peace and Well-Being was kept, 'least for today.

rhythmic poetry of asphalt street
your worn shoes laying the beat
1AM you're out and fighting the cold
promising yourself _never_ again (behind
long shadows could be
anybody)
on a concrete mattress under rust-red sky
is the city that never sleeps???
you run through its haunted avenues
trailing rhythm; left, right, left.
