6/15/02

okay, so i woke up today at 6:15AM, facedown on my bed, desk lamp still on and speakers still blaring. i guess last night i decided to just take a "rest" before brushing my teeth.. hehe and i guess i never woke up. sallgood.. luckily i'd finished packing the afternoon before. anyways our family got to the San Jose (now dubbed "Mineta International") airport about an hour before our flight. i spent a good 30 minutes hunting for an open power slot along the walls for this laptop.. and never really found one =D

boarded our flight and sat down for a wonderfully exciting 3 and a half hours of fun. man.. those planes are pretty crowded. i put my backpack up in the overhead bins and when i brought my arm back down i smacked this old man in the head with my elbow x.x

i kinda tried to apologize profusely.. but i guess that doesnt always work haha.. he just sat there and stared straight ahead. yikes.. sorry dude..

got to O'Hare Intl (Chicago) and transferred over to a plane that'd take us over to Buffalo Int'l. a bit more tolerable, i might add. so anyways when we got there, we got our van rented and headed out to Niagara Falls, NY. found our hotel, and of course, being from the good old PST, i couldnt sleep till like 1:30AM. thats decent.

i might add that i think i've got a pretty severe case of tinnitus. you know, when you got that ringing sensation in your ear? it's been going pretty good for like 4 hours now.. aw man.. my dad's side of the family is known for bad hearing.. uh oh i hope i didnt get an early case of hearing loss. cuz that'd really suck. gah i guess its time to turn down the volume..
