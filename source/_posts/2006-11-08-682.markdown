She is retracing her steps, left over right and front over back. holding herself tight to keep from shuddering in the brisk nighttime chill. It is dusk, and the crowd of waiting riders is growing impatient. The 51 bus never comes on time.  
  
She is retracing her steps in three-four, illuminated by a single streetlight, swaying over each corner of sidewalk tile. She is studying the ground in full concentration, because she can't quite remember where she is.   
  
I cannot see her face, but know she is plainly beautiful.  
  
She is mesmerizing: off to the side, under the awning, waltzing by herself, retracing her steps.
