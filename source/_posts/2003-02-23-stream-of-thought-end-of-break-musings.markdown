i need to get out and run, but my body tells me otherwise. my mind guilt trips me, but my lazy muscles tell me otherwise. come on andrew. you're a track runner. you live for this stuff.

but do i? i've been questioning lately whether i should be out running track or not. questioning my motives, that's what i've been doing. why am i out there? is it to get in shape? to have fun? to meet people? am i prepared to give it my all?

if i'm not ready to give 100% of my effort to track, then there is no longer a reason for me to stay. i'm wondering whether my hesitation is due to academic stress or due to pure laziness. when you start getting lazy.. that's when it all goes downhill and that's what i'm feeling right now. and i hate it.

in any case, i've really had a pretty enjoyable week.. in terms of really being able to hang out and relax and take it easy. the soph/junior sisters in CIA prepared us soph/junior guys an outdoor lunch as their "appreciation" gesture to us.. haha thanks guys.. it really means a lot to us. we're planning a top secret operation where more details will be released. but mr. chau's and the astrojump arent bad ideas..  8O :)

i've been really frustrated with the way i've been acting lately.. with my pride and all recently. i mean, i try to act all humble and nonchalant about my own abilities but inside.. _argggh_. **i hate it.** praying for humility.. humility that's **real.**

i've noticed that my sisters are starting to get louder and louder. at the dinner table it's like a decibel contest... they get so excited and wow it's like a rock concert hahahaha.. kind of funny. weird thing is that when they get louder, i get quieter. i feel kind of left out of the conversation, ya know? yeah.. it sometimes frustrates me, but i know that's who they are and i guess i gotta deal with it.

speaking of introversion, i'm also noticing that i'm pretty introverted when i'm online on AIM or at home in general but in public situations i act totally differently. i'm sure it's totally normal but yeah.. makes me feel like i'm fake or something. the question is: of the extro and the introverted andrews, which andrew is fake?

oh, and don't call me andrew anymore. there's so many andrews in the world. i think _drew_ or _andre_ or plain _dre_ would be pretty cool, dontcha think? okay, maybe not.
