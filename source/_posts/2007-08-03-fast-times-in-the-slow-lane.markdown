Okay, so a few of you know that I've been obsessed with [hypermiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy-maximizing_behaviors) (further explained in a [Mother Jones article](http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/01/king_of_the_hypermilers.html)) for a few months now. Hypermiling is basically the art of driving in a way that you squeeze the maximum fuel economy out of your car.

_Disclaimer: I'm a bit of a mileage wonk. Particularly because I see fuel economy as some sort of a game (albeit with higher consequences).Â _

On average I'm able to get 310 miles out of a tank of gas in my 2002 4-cylinder Honda Accord (mixed driving on highway and city roads). That's 20.9 MPG. On bad months of pure city driving, I'll get maybe 280 miles on a tank (18.9 MPG). On a highway road trip, I'll push 360 miles a tank (24.3 MPG).

This past month I hypermiled on a tank of gas. I ended up with 394 miles on a tank (approximately 26.4 MPG). That's a 20% increase in mileage--not bad! I think of that as a 20% discount on a tank of gas.

There's a few driving tips from the hypermiling pros I've adopted (whether they'll stick with me in the long-term, is another matter):



	
  * **Slow, constant acceleration:** Always gently depress the accelerator pedal coming from a standstill. There's no rush and there's no use in burning gas on rapid starts and stops.

	
  * **Know your car's power curve:** After a while you can figure out which speeds in which gear give your car the best speed/mileage ratio. I usually lock into the bottom end of third gear on city roads--at that point, I'm barely feeding any gas and maintaining speed at 30MPH. On highways I ease off around 55-60MPH.

	
  * **Don't use the brakes (kinda):** Okay, this is admittedly one of my more dangerous habits. I attempt to brake as little as possible because braking is essentially throwing momentum (e.g. gas) away. So that means spacing myself away from the car in front so I can try to even out the jerk of start and stop traffic with a constant low velocity. That also means taking turns at higher speeds (don't try this with passengers).

	
  * **Hills are your friends**: I shift into neutral coming down some longer hills and overpasses instead of gassing, letting momentum take me down hills.

	
  * **Slower is better:** When I'm not in a hurry, I take the slow lane and dial it back to 50-60MPH. That's actually a pretty optimal speed for most cars and trucks. But to make up for this, you'll have to leave for your destination about 5-10 minutes earlier so you don't feel rushed.

	
  * **Draft... carefully**: Drafting, a trick reserved for NASCAR drivers, usually means driving closely behind larger vehicles (usually trucks). You get better gas mileage because the truck has essentially carved out a channel in the air for your car, and there is less air resistance for your car to "push" against. Warning: This is technically tailgating and is probably ridiculously dangerous. I usually just try to pull up behind a big rig and follow it at a distance and hope for _some_ sort of fuel-saving effect (I'm not willing to play with my life though...)

	
  * **Swallow your pride:** So other people think you drive like a sissy. You pull up to the gas pump and your wallet is your vindication.

	
  * **Uh, but don't forget to drive safely**: Recklessly taking turns at 40MPH or tailgating some dude by a matter of inches or driving so slow that you disrupt traffic flow are all dumb ideas. Don't do 'em. And before you try any of this stuff, can you sign my liability waiver?
