**1. lynbrook's last football game**
i witnessed my first (and last) lynbrook touchdown of the season.

**2. sup cool guy 2**
lil ryan ngai decided to "dress up as andrew hao" for halloween. gosh i wish i had a picture of that shirt. ahha thanks cool kid, you made my day.

**3. (the last) lynbrook center meet**
my sixth time running this course.. i think i PRed but not by as much as i wish i could have. gjob to the team, we're second only to MV hahaha.. very nice  :)  something's up with the way i run, i'm just wondering if there's some sort of psychological barrier i've got to break through.

**4. (the last) lodi band review**
i'm writing this about 20 minutes before i leave, so we'll see what happens...

**5. i finish my stanford app**
essays are haphazardly chucked out and rewritten this morning at 6AM, i slept on the floor beneath my computer.
