When people hear that I'm going to Botswana, the questions I hear the most are the following:






  1. Whoa, is it safe there?


  2. What will you be doing?




To which I answer:






  1. Yeah, Botswana's safe. It's politically and economically as stable as South Africa.


  2. I may be doing multimedia/communication work with [Love Botswana](http://lovebotswana.org). I'm not exactly sure what this is, but I suspect it could have to do with [Studio 7](http://www.lovebotswana.org/departments/studio7.html), the organization's radio broadcasting ministry. I really don't know in what capacity I'm going to help out with, so it could be in everything from audio production/mixing/mastering to sweeping the floors.




Even though Sarah and I have this ideal idea of how we could fit in or how our skills can be used, I think we're both preparing to go in real humbly and help out in the big things and little things.




### So why are you going?




I'm coming alongside Sarah, who's planned to come on this trip for a long time. It's technically a "scouting trip," which means that we're going to get a big picture overview with how the organization runs and to better see how we can fit in. It's an intermediary trip for those who are interested in possibly coming on board for a longer period of time.




To back it up even further, I knew that Africa was a big part of Sarah's dreams for her future when we started dating. Which wasn't easy because I couldn't see myself in Africa… I had plans to join the industry doing whatever geeky, nerdy, software engineering gig I had prepped myself for at UC Berkeley. It's been an interesting time as we've progressed in our dating relationship, because we had to talk about the possibility of God calling Sarah and myself different directions: to Africa and to the States.




That's a whole 'nother talk for another time, but I think the conclusion I've come to is: live or die in the States or Africa, whether I get to experience life overseas on mission or stateside on mission in the workforce, I recognize that a heart treasuring and compelled by the Gospel is far more important than whether I get to be labeled as "missionary" or "engineer." And so may my heart be set by that one passion: to know and love Jesus deeper and deeper, to die to myself daily, to have my  heart changed and moved by the things that move the heart of God.
