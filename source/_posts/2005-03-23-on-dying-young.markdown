He doesn't find it funny, how it was when he was young and waiting for his mother to pick him up from school that every minute she is late grows more certain the possibility she has died. It is always death, as he would wait outside and agonizingly ponder every single one of the infinite possibilities as to a painful end. It would be in the headlines: Mother on Road, Hit by Drunk Driver. Mother of Four Dies in House Fire. Mother Taking Stroll, Assaulted By Russian Attack Dogs, Cannot Retrieve Son from School. Then it would be accompanied by a sigh of relief as he would spot the silhouette of the minivan, red, rescuing and approaching in the distance.

Die, she nearly did on one night as it was approaching six o'clock and the sky, somber orange was threatening to turn off and all that was left was him running circles around the lone parking lot lamp. The minivan came tearing into the lot, three hours too late and a breathless, blushing mother kissing him over and over and breathing "I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I forgot, I forgot." He forgave her for that.

He doesn't find it funny how he fears everybody's about to die and they don't. He worries for them when they don't show up to meals, or miss appointments or don't return his calls. He is half-angry, half-overjoyed when they do. It's the half-and-half part that gets to him. He doesn't know what to feel.
