awwrightt.. its raining again :) it needs to rain more often.. i love it when its raining.

ugh.. chem test (equilibrium) really stunk badly.. i caught so many tricks that mr flores pulled on us (or at least i THOUGHT they were tricks).. and i'm very sure that i overlooked more than a few. i just really stink at time management during his tests. my part3 problem took up over half my time and i didnt have time to go over the bonus problems. sigh.. oh well.. i'll get this score dropped.

mr flores won't teach next AP next year. okay, so he has like the toughest grading policy on the face of the planet and just about half the class is failing.. but man when i compare ourselves to the other chem teachers'.. the difference really shows. we know our stuff, bahahha.

anyways, i'm hoping that a really good chem teacher gets brought in next year..and i hate to say this but it's just not gonna be the same without him..

i think i've decided now.. i'll just take calc at deanza (no chem). anybody know how the courses work? what's "Math 1A" equivalent to? i need a course equivalent to calc B..

helped out at the lynbrook library today, packing up books and stuff. haha.. there was a tonna pizza left over.. i brought home a whole box of it. that's more stuff for me to eat in math.

on a more serious note, i was kinda thinking.. i dont really know my friends.. not on the level i'm looking for. maybe its cuz i'm a guy.. i dunno.. i guess i need to work on that.
