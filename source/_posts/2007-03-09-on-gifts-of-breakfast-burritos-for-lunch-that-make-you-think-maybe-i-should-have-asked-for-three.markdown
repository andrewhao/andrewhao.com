Two weeks ago, I was at the Terrace scavenging (that's the best word I have for it) for some food late in the afternoon. All the sandwiches were either too expensive or sold out, so I was looking at the breakfast burritos. Now keep in mind that breakfast burritos are right on the border between "I could buy two of these for a somewhat-reasonable price" and "I can only afford one and hope it fills me up." I grab one.  
  
At that moment I think to myself "wouldn't it be sweet if that lady behind the counter gives me another one?" That's silly, so I brush it off.   
  
I'm moving towards the beverage fridge to pick up some juice and wondering how I'm going to cope with this pathetic lil' lunch when the lady behind the counter goes "Sweetie, why don't you take another burrito? We're closing up anyways."  
  
I had two burritos that afternoon, and they couldn't have been tastier. Thanks God. Always the good gifts. (I have another one of these stories that happened to me recently, but why don't you ask me in person :D).
