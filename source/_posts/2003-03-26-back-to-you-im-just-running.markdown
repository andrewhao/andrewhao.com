so today for our workout, charles and i are pulling up on the last half mile stretch of the blaney loop and we're pushing it pretty hard when a van passes by, windows rolled down and from the inside you can hear the high-decibel, female squeals of "CHARRRRLIIIIIIIEEEE!!!!"

first thought: "AAH! that stud!"
second thought: "what am i, chopped liver?"

hahahha naw.. but man charles is such a girl magnet. when will it stop? will they ever stop flinging themselves at him?

LoNeRoNtHeStReEt (3:35:22 AM): look look at what we're doing
LoNeRoNtHeStReEt: talking this late at night
LoNeRoNtHeStReEt: we're crazy
gsgninE: nothing is sacred anymore
gsgninE: what have we become
LoNeRoNtHeStReEt: we r losing innocence
LoNeRoNtHeStReEt: by the second
gsgninE: word.

history and math to catch up on.. bleagh. as usual my 4AM crew is still up.. i wonder why it's always just us. are we different? special? we stink at time management?

i've been stressin so bad lately.. i dunno but i've been worrying myself sick over every single lil thing that i've had responsibility over or whatnot.. i'm handing em over to God.. and man it feels so... freeing. i get so caught up in the details and the hectic pace of everyday life that i'm always losing perspective.. GOd you take control of my life.. i'm sick of stressing, sick of all this pressure and drama. take my life and mold me.

running back to You.
