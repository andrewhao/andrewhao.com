To an old friend:

It's a little scary to see you change so fast, but then I'm a little happy, a little thankful that you have too. It's kinda hard to let go of who I wanted you to be and who you are right now. You're meeting new people, seeing, looking and living a little differently nowadays. Makes me wonder whether you're moving too fast or I'm just moving too slow.

Go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Best wishes dawg.
