This past week I've heard voices that remind me of my failures and _inadequacy_--



	
  * I'm struggling academically because I'm not working hard enough.

	
  * I'm turned down for interviews because I'm not smart enough.

	
  * I'm trapped in cycles of sin because I haven't been applying myself to prayer/Scripture/meditation.

	
  * I'm no longer a dreamer because I've burnt out.

	
  * I'm single because I'm afraid to take risks (e.g. too careful).

	
  * I'm passive because I lack some component of manhood.


This has been a rough time of wrestling. My identity in Jesus is really in tatters right now, and all this condemnation has really been tough to bear.
