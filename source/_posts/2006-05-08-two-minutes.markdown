[HE, a young man stands in corner of room, back turned away from HIM, a fatherly figure. A chair in the middle of the room.]

HE: [paces room] It's like I'm standing here at the precipice, some sort of mile high mountain [stands up on chair] and I'm looking down at the valley below and I scream and the valley's so wide that my echo comes back to me a million times softer than before.

HIM: [whisper] My son, my son.

HE: Can't you see? Can't you see? I'm screaming for something, but I don't know why. And the echoes come back and I think that's all you are, God! Some sort of echo that I somehow need to pick out, decipher, cut out all the noise, and I have to do it all myself!

[Sits down in Chair, holding head in hands.]

HE: [voice breaking] Can't you see? I just want to please You. But I'm so lost. So lost. And all I do is read verses like "If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him" and I can't help but question why... [pause] why I still love this world so much if I know so many things in my _head_ but not in my heart.. I can't figure it out. Dad, I can't figure this out.

HIM: [walks behind HE in chair, puts hands on HE's shoulders]

HE: And it's a lonely place, this Mount Everest and the air's thin and I can't scream much longer. And I'm starting to feel whispers of doubt, they clutch my heart and dry my bones and I start to question whether the love of you, my Dad, is really in me.

HIM: My son, I am Always.

[Fade]
