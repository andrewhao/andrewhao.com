there's something to be said about writing blog entries. i mean, either you write periodically but with powerful concisiveness (word?). or you just go all out and bore your audience to death with um-today-i-did-x-y-z-a-b-c entries daily.

but hey, since it's summer, i'm allowed to do this. what were you expecting, **DRAMA**?

haha.. yeah but seriously.. summer's actually more busy than i thought it'd be. my dad was telling me how he hoped that i'd "relax" a bit more.. hahaha.. uh.. i'd forgotten how to do that a lonnnng time ago.

calc hw is really boring. really really boring. and it doesnt even count for your grade. but that doesnt keep me from doing em all (that's work ethic for you. that's what's gonna kill me)

thomas talked in youth service today on the motives that we had in serving in the church.. and i kinda realized that my motivations were sometimes in the wrong place. it's like worshipping and serving God all of a sudden took second place to meeting friends, playing guitar etc. so yeah.. it was a good reminder for me.

after church everybody left for applebee's.. but vinny, channing jack and i went to jack in the box. and man, that stuff is cheap. what have i been missing out on.. western cheeseburger for 99cents?! consider me sold.

ended up sleeping through the afternoon and missed basketball @ campbell. next time. plus i suck now too.

so much for the shoe deal.
