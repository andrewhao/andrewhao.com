i woke up today and realized my entire family was awake before me. apparently my dad wanted us to get up early enough to beat the early morning traffic that's ever-so-present in NYC. well, hate to break it to you, dad, but you're dealing with ME ahha..

well i did manage to wake up (i was sleeping on the floor, so that wasnt too much of a problem). today we traveled across the city to manhattan, where as we all know, dwell the elite, the powerful and the rich. hahha.. it was pretty cool watching all those buildings i've seen only in books or on tv in real life. i could only try to imagine how the WTC towers woulda looked... i bet they'd be pretty impressive. my mom wanted to see the metropolitan museum of modern art. i didnt really wanna.. but i made up my mind to keep my mouth shut haha.. it really wasnt all that bad, but my final impressions of it were mostly that it was just _way too big_

NYC subway adventures haha.. the subways werent as ghetto as i'd imagined.. but they werent super squeaky clean either (take taipei's subway for example =D) the trains were actually pretty nice. A/C.. no (excessive) tagging.. well lighted. good thing we didnt hafta travel by night, that would've been interesting.

we watched the Phantom of the Opera off of Broadway tonight. it was real cool, really elaborate. i had no idea what broadway was like before this, and now i can understand why they charge those exorbitant ticket prices =P i cant believe this show is still running. it's what.. 15 years old by now? wahtever.. the theater was still pretty crowded and the crowd stilll seemed to enjoy it. i sure did.

of the asian races in this city, there seem to be a lot more koreans than any other asian (i mean pacific-rim-asian) people i noticed. no idea why, or maybe all the chinese or japanese are located somewhere else haha.. our hotel is located right in the middle of a pseudo Korea-town. the entire street is lined with small korean food shops, cafes, bars etc.

what i found really interesting is how all the koreans are worked up over their soccer team. on a few shop windows i found posters of the national soccer team, words of congratulations and even a taunting "WHO'S NEXT?" on a flyer. some guy even decked out his mercedes SUV with three korean flags and korean lettering i can't read (no duh) along the side of his car. pretty interesting. it must be a cultural thing. i mean, all the koreans i know are really worked up over this.

us chinese?
"oh, we lost?"
"oh, we have a team?"
haha.. well in a country of 2 billion people, statistics dictates taht someone good EVENTUALLY is gonna get produced. that's right baby! better watch out. just give us 50 years.

life goes on.
