up on the hills on the bike today and i was getting pretty woozy. i'm talking dehydrated-woozy. thank God the trails werent too bad, because i dont know if i would have been able to make it down without a major faceplant on the way.

jazz (esp piano) is incredible. makes me happy. went to the library and checked out a stack of CDs that are playing on rotation currently. my goodness, how cool would it be to jam in a jazz band.

you know what i wanted to be? the first ever rock star-graphic designer-writer-pastor-comedian-filmographer, or something to that effect. it'd be nice, but somehow i don't think that's what God wants from me. maybe something simpler.
