It is chilly December, I am late for class and walking fast with a skateboard under my left arm, quickly past an unkempt man dressed as if he were in the glory days of Berkeley in the 60's. He stops me and asks why I don't ride the skateboard.  
  
"Because I'd look like an idiot," I reply. This was indubitable.  
  
"So?" He shoots me the biggest grin I've ever seen.  
  
I thought about that long and hard.
