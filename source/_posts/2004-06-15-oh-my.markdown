i'm back from Cal student orientation, phew it was a lot of fun but also pretty overwhelming at times. i know nobody cares, but just a quick recap for myself:

sunday night:
-alex choy's dad drives up choy, young lee and me to berkeley where we do early check-in
-we check into unit 3, norton where we find a bunch of the SoCal guys hanging watching NBA Finals game 4. got to know a couple of the guys
-took raymond with us to eat some korean BBQ. good stuff, although it probably wasn't even close to the real thing  :)
-find jon wong from MV and his friend (aw man i forgot his name already) and we wander half of the city. good stuff.
-back to dorms, hang out with the rest of the floor

monday:
-up early at 7, find glen wong from tino, massive checkin to orientation
-lynbrook: diana lin, allen chang, eugene p., blaine kim, charles chen, young lee, alex choy, me.
-pimental hall orientation with 500+ seats. wow.
-first thing out of speaker's mouth: cal is insanely hard (or something to that effect), i want to break your will (thanks, i'm scared).
-meet nancy (group leader) and the other calSO guys. cool guys, no girls (notice how this is the engineering calSO)
-wander campus, more talks, more seminars
-figure out that no, i really don't know which classes to take.
-lunch on the lawn. i grab the free food, then some more. human pyramid, ultimate frisbee.
-smuggled free food leaks in my backpack and (un)fortunately all over my papers.
-we fill out class registration cards. i really realize that i don't know which classes to take.
-more talks, but who cares it's dinner.
-crossroads. hmm, leave it at that.
-more talks, diversity discussions, "i can't believe ANYBODY would want to discourage girls from engineering.. i bow to girls"
-hanging out at night. random PMT shops, arcade, watch some insane DDR masters.
-half the floor is in my room. i kind of wish they would leave so i could get my classes scheduled out, but it wouldn't have happened anyways cuz i didn't know what the heck i wanted to take anyways.
-feet are numb, dead.
-sleep at 2AM

tuesday
-up at 7
-more walking around. student ID, more walking around. up tower, more walking around, down tower. feet are burnt to a crisp.
-sign up for classes. remember how i never figured out which classes i wanted and was worried about how they'd schedule out? well it didn't matter cuz the class/discussions were full anyways. don't worry, it was just some of them. you nonengineers, don't worry. sweet!
-walking, talking, cal band great, go homee
-top dog, BART, home

and finally to cap it all off: history repeats itself?
