driving down the road it's 11PM you get a case of the sudden Sads as the Negro spiritual seems to pound into your flesh from every bump and clod on the road, singing _"oh Lord, trouble so hard, oooh Lord, troubles so hard"_ into you, bumping and jarring you into a ferverent melancholy state, leaving you wondering what in the world has gotten into yourself only to realize that that's it exactly, it IS the world. and the weight of it you feel you can't handle even as you slow down to the stop sign and stop, breathing hard and there's nothing but that spiritual coursing through your tissue-paper veins; it is your loudest cry.
