i'm dreaming more often nowadays, but somehow they're not of the
type that are particularly memorable. you know, no death-defying action
scenes worthy of hollywood, i think the closest i got was waiting in
line at a McDonalds. or maybe the time i dreamed i was nodding off in
bio class, now tell me if that's not a) ironic and b) terrifying.




maybe it's a subconscious nudge telling me to treasure every moment
no matter how mundane it is because my life needs to be lived out to
the fullest. or maybe i'm just making up excuses to sleep in a couple
more hours =)

_ack, i'm so sorry. i dont have a clue what you're going
through. that's what scares me, i can't empathize. and i apologize because i should
have done something so much earlier. give me chance. i'd like to hear what you
have to say, if you'd drop your facade for just a moment..._
