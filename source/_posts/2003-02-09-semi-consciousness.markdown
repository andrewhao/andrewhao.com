i'm going to skip the usual grumbling about school and sleep and just say that i'm not handling the former very well and i dont get enough of the latter.

went to the key club conclave (regional meeting) today in support of LHS' very own Tianqi Zhao who was running for lieutenant governor. the lucky guy won, but we knew that long beforehand  :) good job dude.

rushed home early and off to the joint wind ensemble concert with saratoga at west valley college. we played all right i guess.. i made a pretty serious blooper at the beginning of _symphonic movement_ and i was worried about getting lynched by either the a) band or the b) audience but thankfully none of those have happened. not yet at least. this is bad.. whenever i start worrying about a section of music i am almost guaranteed to jack it up.. this applies to any sort of concert or recital. yep.. that's just blah.

but yeah.. SHS wind ensemble has an awesome tone.. i really like their sound. personally i think LHS wind has really been struggling with a lack of brass power and a lot of slackers.. that's just sort of frustrating when you know that you could be so much better. but yeah.. speak for yourself andrew.

worship practice went on a bit longer than expected on friday afternoon and so i missed charles' bday dinner but i heard yall had fun.. wishing you an awesome 17 years.

and i'm off to bed right now.. spanish project and a zillion other major assignments to do tomorrow.. maybe if i sleep they'll just go away..
