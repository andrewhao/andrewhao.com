In a rain-drenched Dominican Republic (when thunder rolls over the hills at two-o-clock every afternoon), I am exiting a wood-framed church with a grey-haired priest when a silent anxiety overcomes me and I sit on a warm mahogany pew, overcome with homesickness.  
  
I thought of you in the strangest of places, and brush it aside as a vestige of youthful infatuation.  
  
But I rarely think of you. Your face shifts and changes, and our Polaroid print memories blur and fade in the sun. With time, I remember less of who you were (I say "were" because I do not think I know who you are now, nor you I).   
  
All but for one thing; you always evoke memories of home.
