so i finally sat down today to start my homework just to realize -

wow.. i barely have any.

what do i do? haha i keep feeling like i have to get something done and be productive. something just seems out of whack if i don't do SOMETHING. that's one of my problems - i just don't know how to slack  8) i may have contracted my dad's self-proclaimed workaholicism.. hrm.

yeah.. well my spanish presentation yesterday pretty much STUNK. oh man.. i was fumbling for words and my brain pretty much stopped functioning right when i stepped up there. gah.. teaches me not to write the thing at 3AM and start memorizing 1st period the day it's due.

started pool workouts yesterday (cuz i'm a gimp, remember?  :) ) with hank. andrew xiao is hurt too.. so it was nice having someone else to share the suffering. hahaha. it was a good workout for the body parts that aren't malfunctioning.

i dont think i can run the meet on friday.. and that kind of worries me because varsity's chances of going CCS really diminish. gah.. must heal faster..

new chem packet is monstrous. should've started already. but hey.. lots of time tonight so i think i'll do that  :)

rise and fall of rome remix? coming soon (maybe) to a computer near you! yeah right.. i wish..
