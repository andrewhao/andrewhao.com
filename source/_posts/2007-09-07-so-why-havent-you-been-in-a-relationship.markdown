I'm realizing that "I'm too busy" is a pathetic, pathetic little answer.

---

Eh, I haven't kept folks updated on my love life. It's something I used to be totally candid about, but somehow I've been less willing to talk about it (online and in person) maybe because I feel like the pressure has increased in these last few years.

I usually give folks one of two answers when asked about my love life:

1. "Oh, I've actually really been growing as a single dude and haven't really felt the need to get a girlfriend yet. I'm _really_ satisfied in Jesus." Some days I'll really mean it. And some days I'll fake my best smile.

2. "Soon..." I'll give you a vague smile to make you think like I have a plan to ask this girl out in the next few days or weeks or years. I just won't tell you specifics.

"Oh, you've never been in a relationship before?" People will usually repeat this aloud to themselves (maybe they don't believe me), then they tend to stare at me in this quizzical, critical, _impatient_ manner like I'm a zillion miles behind in the EQ Olympic Sprint/Marathon.

_A recollection slightly tangential to the point I'm making:
_

I was painfully awkward in elementary school leading into 7th grade. I covered this up with a smiley nice-guy persona. Totally harmless. Totally spineless. Pretty darn shy, especially around girls. I theoretically knew they existed. They even seemed to be in my classes. Too bad I never really talked to any of them, much less made friends with them. My first conversation with a g1rl was in the seventh grade. It lasted about 10 seconds and I was so proud of myself.

_End recollection slightly tangential to the point I'm making.

High school was better, but not by much. I figure out that girls aren't so intimidating after all. I even made friends with a few, and had crushes on a fair share of them.

But let's pair this still-awkward, more-or-less robotic interactions I have with girls _and_ let's couple it with the "don't date in high school-_or-else_" mentality that's pretty prevalant in the Asian church (that's a another story) and you have a recipe for the "let's be _friends_ but keep our distance so that we won't raise the chances of developing feelings/become codependent/be distracted from studies/fatally fall in love/make babies/drink from the flask of heartbreak too soon" mentality.

_(To be continued...!) _
