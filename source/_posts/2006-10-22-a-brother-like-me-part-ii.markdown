"It's a trip," Mike tells me as we lean against Gypsys' restaurant, "watching that guy do his thing."

James, an African-American man dressed in jeans and a nylon jacket, is shaking the cup in front of the Asian Ghetto. He's singing something akin to a gospel spiritual. I say help a friend, I say helllp a friend with the charm and gusto of a stage performer. His voice is rich and boomy, but more impressively he continues to sing as people pass him by. Just a lil bit of change, I say, help a friend.

Mike just shakes his head. "It's a trip cuz I'm seeing it from the outside. And I'm watching all these people passin' and, I dunno man, it's such a trip."

There is an unwritten rule for working a spot. Once somebody has arrived, the place is in his possession until he leaves. A part of this is practical, because two people working the same spot means half the earnings. A part of this is simply being honorable to the livelihood of the other man.

The first time I asked Mike if I could pray for him, I was surprised by the immediacy of his response and the quickness by which he grabbed my hand and bowed his head. We prayed with our hands clasped in some sort of handshake.

I found Mike talking to another student one night. It turned out he was from the Navigators fellowship. I asked him if we could pray for Mike together. He agreed, and we both clasped our hands around Mike's, praying God's healing, mercy and love over our brother. People were laughing at the sight, but let me tell you it was beautiful.

It's very hard for me to believe in those sorts of prayers, especially with the realities of life that Mike faces daily. I tend to think that Mike has greater faith than I do. He told me a week later, "You know Drew, whenever people pray for me, the pain stops. God bless me, Drew. He's working."

Mike's medication prescription has expired, leaving him without his nitroglycerine pills (in addition to his water pills and his iron pills). He gives me a call one day in class, and I pick up to hear his light drawl over the phone. "Listen, man, Andrew, I need to talk to you."

His temporary Medicare coverage has expired (it was a 90-day pass), leaving him without the ability to pay for his prescription meds held for him at Highland County Hospital in Oakland. "Andrew, I need some twenty-five bucks."

I stop when I hear this over the phone. You see, Mike has this vibe that he wants my company more than he wants my money. That's what I like about him. But this is important, and I have no time to doubt his intentions so I tell Mike I can meet him later that afternoon.

"Andrew, you're my real partner" (Mike drawls partner into pardner) he tells me as we meet at dusk. I don't know how to respond to that.

He gets the meds and prescription that night ("The doctor goes down to the pharmacy, the pharmacy's closed but he gets my meds for me anyways"). His shakes and flutters have gone away for now, he tells me. Good, I tell him.

I don't know Mike's last name. It's certainly crossed my mind that should Mike pass away, I should find out on some sort of public database. But I don't know his last name, and the possibility of death haunts me (particularly after not seeing him in front of his typical place in front of the Asian Ghetto for awhile). I don't know Mike's last name, because to me he's Mike, his estranged wife is Belinda, his cousin is Cal and somehow that is enough for him.

Note to self: find out Mike's last name.

Mike bounces around from relative to relative, moving as often as they'll let him stay. Oftentimes he'll be kicked out because his relative's "baby momma" didn't like him, or because his sister's financial situation was worse than his own. He comes in to sleep at 12AM and leaves as early as possible, often at 6AM. He's currently staying with cousin Cal, who has acquired a "crazy girl" as described by Mike. She has taken a liking to Cal... and Mike. "I ain't getting intimate with her" Mike tells me with a fiery look in his eyes. Cousin Cal thinks differently. "Hey cuz," he tells Mike, "why don't you spend some time with her?" Mike laughs. "That girl crazy." He laughs some more. "I'm holding true to my word."

Mike's been to prison before, for some petty crimes and finally to the big house in 1986 for selling weed on a street corner to a man who turned out to be an undercover cop. "I regret every one of those decisions" he tells me. He was engaged to Belinda in 86 with a child and one on the way (if I can remember correctly). "I can still remember that day I went out to sell. Belinda was calling out to me telling me to go straight. Worst decision of my life." After the arrest, he spent 10 years in the big house, San Quentin. "I never got to see my children grow up. And now I can't see them anymore."

As previously mentioned, I suspect that much of the reason why I like Mike and have hit it off so well is because he's rarely directly asked me for money.

Mike calls me up today. "Andrew, man, I gotta talk to you man." He repeats himself: "I need to talk to you man. I need some cash."

This is the second time he's called and asked for cash. I begin to regret giving him my number, and the other million associated doubts flutter in my head again.

This request brought back some bad memories in my mind of previous
encounters with other men on the streets who have taken advantage of me. More doubts flutter in my mind. Am I being a softie? He's probably gonna get some more booze with that change. He's no different from the others.

And I want to, at that moment,
hang up on Mike. I hesitate, for maybe a moment too longï¿½

I remember that my God, who knew that I'd abuse his grace and mercy far ahead of time, died for me anyways. Did it cheapen his death? No, it amplified my need for Himï¿½

"Andrew, I need the cash for my niece's birthday tomorrow. I'm gonna go over to Walgreens and get her a doll. I wanna be there for her birthday, man."

Can I trust this man? I ask myself. Does it even matter, in light of what I've done for you? God gently reminds me.

I meet with Mike that night (he comes to Berkeley on the BART) and give him some money. It is one of the hardest things I've ever done, because my doubts about him are still there. I'm still feeling the fool for handing over cash to Mike, a man I could possibly call a friend but who is so removed from my universe.

"You show me so much love, Drew." He grips my hand hard. I am reluctant to return his embrace.

I walk back to a dull throb in my head, afraid that this will have been like every other time.

I walk slowly, pondering Grace.
