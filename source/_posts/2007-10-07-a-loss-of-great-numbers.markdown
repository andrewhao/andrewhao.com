So I'm not quite sure what happened, but sometime between last night and this morning, I lost all the contacts in my cell phone. Was it some fluke? A stray cosmic ray collided with a memory cell? Did somebody reprogram my phone out of spite? All we can do is speculate.

So I probably don't have your number anymore (it's nothing personal). And how about the next time you call me, you save me the awkwardness of pretending to recognize you by telling me who you are? Thanksss.


#### I'm curious


What would you do in this situation? Would you come up with some harebrained scheme to trick your friends into sending you their phone numbers? Would you rely on your keen hearing and amazing sense of intuition to guess the caller's identity? Would you just never answer your phone... ever? Maybe you'd profusely apologize without ever saying a word? Or would you just Google your friends (in vain), hoping somebody, somewhere has mined their mobile phone numbers?
