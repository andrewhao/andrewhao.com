i don't know real heartbreak. that happens to you when you've been so sheltered (or protected?) that i realize that i don't know what it's really like to be truly broken.

i guess it's a good thing, but at the same time part of me is wishing that i knew what it felt like. remember mexico, andrew? remember china, the ghettos of oakland, NYC, all those places where you watched broken people _just get along _in life while you stood there feeling a bit ashamed and most of all frustrated because you couldn't empathize. or maybe you could, but you didn't try?

and--
humiliation: felt that again the past week or so as my foolish pride took a beating. so break it down till there's nothing left of me, i can't carry this around anymore. won't work.

and--
nonAIMness is coming along nicely, but the side effect is that i'm losing touch with people, fast. i saw brian kim and walter chang at sedgwick yesterday for 4th of july fireworks and just realized when i left that it was the last time i'd probably ever see them face to face again. yep, that's life.

but--
life's tough like that, and it's time to move on. feeling quite overwhelmed but more and more excited as time goes by for college to start. i don't have a clue how it's gonna work or how it's gonna be or how badly its gonna kick (my) butt but i'm kind of eager to get that new start going on.

well--
lately i've been dreaming every night. pretty boring stuff, always about friends and how we're just sitting around and kicking it. but when i wake up i try to go back to sleep to make it last longer. yeah, there's that warm fuzzy feeling.

anyways, the future holds:
an agape dinner with the new core
hanging out (YSP) with the youth group in Rainbow Park, Tu and Th 2-4:30PM (come!)
helping at dave's retreat july 16-18?
summer retreat july 24-27ish (talk to me for forms)
dorm shopping
room cleaning, then selling junk on ebay
websites: campuschurch.net and the Prayer Continued sites
i need to hang with tam and grab some pho
contact my roomate and try not to scare him away
reconstruction of character.

broken down,
