Presenting the Phat Photo Post, (Almost)-Last-Week Edition!

so we start off with **band awards night**, which was my fourth and thankfully last because my hands were getting awfully tired from all that clapping. major props to all ensembles, first time lynbrook's done an all-ensemble Unanimous Superior sweep:

half of the clarinet section! not pictured: losers who didn't make it in  8O  :(

and then we move onto the famed **English AP Final** which quickly proved to be the Biggest Thing I Didn't Have to Worry About. skits, a t-shirt and food; hey i could get used to this.

excellent food.. minus andrew's spamwiches

now onto **Senior Awards Night** which was bigger than i expected but just as long. and long it was, as 2004 seemed to get every award and honor possible. we are one talented class.

moving onto the **Last Official Day of School** which is traditionally a yearbook-signing and picture taking day. man i was pretty busy that day, running around school trying to find certain adults to get to sign certain forms so i could graduate and whatnot.. phew. OH YEAH! i also got my first cut of my life, and it was for the saddest reason ever. but last day of real school, i guess it's time to break all the rules =)

OKAY and so finally my week ends off with the very last minute **faria class of 1998** reunion, where more people showed up than i had expected. MV had their prom the night before, so most faria-MVers were off sleeping, but wow it was incredible seeing people again and laughing over old memories. i think the biggest thing that struck me was how much we had grown in six years in a really positive way (matured) yet at the same time we didn't outgrow each other.. that is it felt like we were really comfortable with each other.

..i'm missing a couple of other people, can somebody fill me in?

big time reminiscing.. i even thought i'd forget about nerdiness antics, running program, mrs. young's breakdown, shorts days, little kid cruelty to other kids, that 5th grade play "dragonwings", random teachers, walden west and other random snippets of elementary school life.

but yeah we all thought that the others had both really changed and never really changed at all. man we all took different paths, some sports, some music, drama, community service, you name it. but dood we're pretty much on the verge of adulthood, look how far we've come. incredible, no?

so ends this week's installment of "Phat Photo Post", hope your retinas don't burn.
