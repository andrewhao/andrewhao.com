so i drove down to the gilroy outlets today for some long overdue shopping. why gilroy? cheap stuff. cuz you know, i hate to waste.

but it's not all cheap stuff. and sometimes you've gotta fight with yourself to determine whether you wanna buy something cuz it's a good deal.. or just cuz it's really really supercool.

so let me introduce you to the Need Police. it's like a conscience, only amplified to terrifying new levels.

i was in the reebok factory store when it caught me.

me: oo.. sweet shirt.. and only $12.99 too!
NP: _tweeeeeeeeeeeet!_
me: wha? no.. aww.. not now!
NP: what's that you got there son?
me: only the sweetest Iverson screenprinted shirt i've ever seen. and look.. ooh.. pretty colors.
NP: hand that over kid.

and then the Need Police says The Line. The Line insures victory, The Line is a one-hit KO, The Line is the nuclear bomb blast against my flimsy arguments.

NP: Do You Really Need It? (twilight zone sound effects here)

i've lost.

me: well... uh.. ARRRRRR.

ahhaha.. if there's one thing that my dad's burned into my mind, it's knowing how to be frugal. well.. he calls it "not wasting your money". i guess its not such a bad thing, neh?

on the way back up 101 i noticed one of those electronic billboards that the CHP uses to warn you of traffic up ahead.. only this time it read "HAPPY EASTER"  8)

back to church to help out with decorating for the Life Party.. basically it's a night that we at the CIA youth group were putting on to invite our friends to check out.. to have fun and check out what we Christians think life is all about. but ya.. wow julie really transformed that place into something sweet. speaking of sweet, the food was awesome.

so between andrew yip, pris and i, we invited morgan, richard, justine and jennifer chin to come check it out.. hope you guys had a good time! invaded tapX afterwards and chilled for a bit.

i always get a guilt trip when i invade the PMT places cuz i'm too ashamed to bust out my chinese. but that's another story for another entry.

its getting late and my contacts are getting foggy. good night, and happy easter  :)
