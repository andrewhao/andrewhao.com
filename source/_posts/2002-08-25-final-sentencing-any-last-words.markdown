all right.. last day of summer. did i spend it well? well.. not too bad.

band sleepover was last night and we had a blast. actually this year there werent as many people as compared to years past (but we still managed). as usual, i "stole" liberal amounts of candy (enough to last a few months). a few of us (about 6) lugged over our desktop computers and networked em all. here's how it worked:

1. i hook up my computer.
2. i load counterstrike.
3. hordes of underclassmen flood the general vicinity and take my computer hostage.

anyways that was the last encounter i had with my computer till the next morning. my manly pride was a bit beat when people started bragging about their system specs. hey.. but my clunker's still got enough oomph to compete with the best of them. not really.

we fooled around in the gym with some v/bball.. cards and the such. whew.. channing really showed his freaky side. it must have been the sugar. i wont elaborate.

anyways i slept at 4.. woke up at 7-ish and decided two things. **a)** i needed a shower, and **b)** i needed to get back into my own bed. so i lug my stuff back to my car and slowly drive home (i'm VERY "out of it" at the time)

i hit the bed and set my alarm clock for 8:20AM. that should be enough to wake me up by 8:40 so i can get ready for church. no problem.

well guess what.. there was a problem. i'm out like a light and next thing i know, i'm opening one eyelid to the bright red glow of the digital clock reading **11:25**. aw no...

got to church in time to get the final 15 or so minutes of the service. took a little hearty verbal beating from pastor thomas but i guess going for a few minutes is much better than not going at all.

we all went out to tino village to super bowl for some pho afterwards. man.. thats some good stuff if only they didnt pour on the MSG. but i digress.

back home and i wasted time on the computer. i need to stop this.

went over to my aunt's house tonight for my lil cousin's 7th birthday. she had a pinata and all and it took about 20 minutes for it to break - they can really take a beating. they should sell those things to the army.

and whose bright idea was it was to include nerds and runts and all those types of candies with millions of colorful pieces that scatter when the wrappers are broken? not very smart i tell you.

summer definitely passed by too quickly - had some good times, some bad times and some downright boring times.

and i part you with this last thought:
don't drink the water.
