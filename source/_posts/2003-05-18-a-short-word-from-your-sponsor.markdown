yesterday was one **busy** day.. whew. i drove just over 100 miles up and down the bay.. ouch my sore butt  :sad:

anyways i picked up tam in the morning to head over to interprayer at gunn.. we went for about an hour and a half before dragging everyone over to NCBC to help out with the take up the cross rally.

i tried to help out making posters.. but somehow they ended up ugly. i think being male has to do with it.

drove 15 miles down the Bay to vasona park where we were having our church picnic.. now if you've ever seen competitive asian males at their finest, you'd see something similar to the tug of war competition.. hahaha old asian dads playing tug 'o war.. i love it. i promised some of my small group guys i'd bring water guns.. only i didnt exactly get to use em cuz they were busy getting back at the girls. ah, tis springtime when a young man's fancy turns to thoughts of love...

back home where i went with my mom to a information meeting for this summer's upcoming YWAM mexico missions trip.. its sounding like an adventure already.. i'm pretty excited.

okay, so i got lost quite a few times back up to NCBC.. you know one really good way to learn highway routes? get lost on one of them. spend the next hour running random routes till you somehow get there. so much for a masculine sense of direction. and who knew that 101 south really runs east?

helped out with the finishing touches on the decorations in the sanctuary and outside. it was pretty hectic.. people running around doing various preparations, rehearsals, runthroughs.. but it was coming together.

and the rally did come together. you could feel the excitement in that sanctuary.. its that sort of hype you feel when you're pumped and filled with the Spirit.. ahhahha awesome. speaker kory murphy talked about how we focus so much on keeping our lives in order that we get exhuasted and lose track of who we originally fell in love with - **true dat! **i believe that message hit the hearts of those especially in leadership roles. i'm sick of burning out.. i'm tired of running around with so many things to juggle that i no longer have time for the God i'm supposed to be serving in the first place. _"even youths grow tired and weary... but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength."_

i'd heard a few months ago that the event planning wasnt going so well.. but i really do believe that it was the power of God that pulled this event together. i'm hoping that this rally isnt just an event but instead a beginning of something bigger.. a way for christians to begin taking up their crosses on their campuses.. living out the life that was meant for them.

anyways, that's my babbling for today. let's get on to the pictures:

speaker kory murphy of oakland.. awesome guy who knows how to speak!

anyways, to sum it up: God pulled this thing together and blessed it, plain and simple. i'm especially proud of my man andrew yip for volunteering tons of his time to sink into this thing.. seung oh for being brave enough to share his testimony :D

okay that's been enough for today.. God bless yall and i'm off to hw already.
