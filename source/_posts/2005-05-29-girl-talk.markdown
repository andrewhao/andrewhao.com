This year has left me feeling like a relationship guru, like one of those self-assured experts that go on nice shows like "Oprah" and give 10-step quickies and nod their heads real slowly while smiling vaguely at the TV camera. I don't think anything could be further from the truth.

I realize how little I knew about girldom six months ago and marvel at what I know now, when I know even less than I did then.

To tell the truth, girls are scary. No, scratch that. Emotions are scary. Scary as in unpredictable. And scary as in they can complicate things real fast. And everybody goes crazy.

I see so many broken relationships and sometimes I wonder, why, God? Wasn't this whole guy-girl thing and marriage deal designed to be a reflection of Your relationship to us? Then how in the world did we jack it up so bad...

See, that's the problem. I forget that we're all freakin' messed up and imperfect. And I think I expect perfection. Or at the very least, non-craziness. Admittin' this is a very big step fer me, Doc. To be honest, maybe that's unrealistic. Okay, it really is. But what _is_ love, and why can't we get it right?
