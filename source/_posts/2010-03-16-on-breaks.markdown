I've started to take breaks more often in the afternoons. I'll walk down Howard and up 1st to a little courtyard that I've found and just journal and think and watch traffic pass on by.

These days with the weather getting warmer, a walk out in the city is just what I need to recenter and relax. And get some good time in with Jesus too.
