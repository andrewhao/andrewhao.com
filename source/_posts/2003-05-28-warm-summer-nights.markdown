there's something about the sticky warm air that appeals to me. the whirring of the fan on the window, the chirping of the crickets outside. it's a strange thing really. it's something that lets me know that outside the defined edges of my reality, i know so little. it is soft-spoken but powerful - and i'm loving it.

you whisper.
are you ever afraid of losing something good before it's gone?
time stops.
so make it last forever.
