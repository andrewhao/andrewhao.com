God is amazing. some pretty incredible stuff happened today: i sprained my ankle.

well maybe that's not the incredible part (i was kind of expecting to happen some time or another). but you have to hear it:

so i skipped out on the track meet today due to musical committments and also because i felt i wasn't totally ready to run having been out of workouts for a week. so i'm feeling decently confident, i'm thinking that maybe a good run up to hunter's point will do me some good.

hunter's point is four miles away, making it eight miles round trip. it's in fremont older open space preserve, up past seven springs in the cupertino hills. awesome place to go, when you're up there you can see the entire valley (literally). but it's also the last place you want to be stranded.

let's make a long story short, i made it up to hunter's point but the problem was coming down. the dirt on the trails is still pretty gravelly (despite recent rains.. hm) so about halfway down the mountain i guess i'm not paying attention to where my foot falls and it comes down at an incredibly wrong angle, i roll on it and AGHHHHHHH

_GodhelpmeGodhelpmeGodhelpmeGodhelpmeGodhelpme_  is the only thing i can force through gritted teeth.

i'm lying on the trail now, about three and a half miles from home, still up on a mountain and here I am lying smack dab in the middle of a bike trail hollering to nobody. the pain's shooting up my leg and i can't think straight.

second thought: at least it wasn't the right foot. and at least my foot's still attached. and nothing's bleeding.

third thought: if this happens one more time, i'm quitting track.

fourth thought: AWOOOOEEEEEEEEERGH

_help me out, God. a miracle wouldn't be so bad._

i climb over to the side of the trail and try to make a tourniquet out of my sock. it mostly fails.

met some really nice people on the trails. i asked them if they had a cell phone, but they either didn't bring them or they didn't have reception. i tried to keep the disappointment from showing on my face and waved them on. but really nice people.

_i guess i'll have to walk down from here, God._

okay, i was no hero. i managed to limp down the hill, and would you know what was in the parking lot? a TAXICAB.

no driver in it though, i kind of lie down on a log on the side of the parking lot and wait. i hear a voice a couple of minutes later, "you okay?"

it's the taxi driver. he offers me a ride. "it's been awhile since i've been up here, i'm so out of shape," he tells me on the ride home. it's free.

WOW  8O  8O  8O  8O




what are the chances of that happening? a taxi driver taking a hike chances upon a kid with a twisted ankle in some remote trail area.

ahhaha i can't stop smiling. does God provide or what?! okay sure my ankle's sprained, but who cares?!! You get my praise, You get my thanks.

You'll send a taxicab for a twisted ankle. thanks God, You're awesome.
