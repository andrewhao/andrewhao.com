went to ropes course today with a small group of our fellow CIA leaders.. and all in all i can say two things about this:

1. pretty fun
2. pretty tiring
(3. mommy.)

it's kinda funny because if you hear anybody talk about ropes course after they've been there, they always give rave reviews and expound on how scary it was. and i'd be thinking "no way.. both? thats a paradox. can't happen."

and i guess it did.. in a stranger way than i thought possible. hehe.. when you're up there on those poles and about to be blown over by the gusts of wind, your first thought isn't "wheeee this is great!" noooo quite the contrary. you'd be wishing how you'd written your will earlier.

best compliment: "you're the only guy who can go up there and crack jokes."

hey, better die laughing than die screaming. or a combo of both. whatever.

anyways i was dead tired when i got home.. crashed on the couch for a half hour then finally got my butt up and started calc hw. SO HARD! i dont get this differential eqn crud and slope fields and all that. ughhh i need someone to help me out here.

of course, due to the fact i was dead tired, i decided to take a little short break by taking a nap on the bed. you know what that means. i'm a heavy napper by nature (or by need) and kinda didnt wake till about 2AM.. which is why i'm posting this late.

anyways, church tomo, cell leader meeting, basketball 2-4 then to august baptism. and i will sleep earlier. really.
