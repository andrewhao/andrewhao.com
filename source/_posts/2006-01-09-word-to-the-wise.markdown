So my dad basically laid it out to me tonight: stop overcommitting/overworking or else you'll get cancer. He's serious.

Ryan thinks so too.

(on overworking)
Gsgnine: man maybe we need to learn to uh.. rest
Gsgnine: remember what that was
R y a n Waliany: haha
R y a n Waliany: i know
Gsgnine: i dont remember mang
R y a n Waliany: its hard
R y a n Waliany: haha

(on likely RSI)
R y a n Waliany: php should have never been invented
R y a n Waliany: for our sakes
Gsgnine: hahaha yea
R y a n Waliany: but then we'd probably be trying to invent it
