Overcast days make beautiful days.

You ever walk down the street, headphones clamped on tight and a song comes on that makes you feel like it's a scene out of a movie? Like there should be a camera crew following you around? Either you're doing the slow-serious contemplative walk down the street to the slow hand-picked guitar melody, or you're bouncin down Shattuck with your punk-pop tunes or you're pissed after your physics final and you're crankin' Black Sabbath or Metallica?
