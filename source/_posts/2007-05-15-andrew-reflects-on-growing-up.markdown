Junior year has brought on a whole new wave of responsibilities and realizations that you're only getting older. Here are a few of my own:  


  1. Realizing that I'm a few years off of the working world.  

  2. Witnessing the beginnings of a soul patch. Boo. Yeah. Hipsterhood, here I come.
  3. Holding a decent conversation about politics.
  4. Holding a decent conversation about politics at a cocktail party.
  5. Holding a decent conversation about politics at a cocktail party and wishing the hosts would bring out Teddy Grahams over the hors de'oeuvres.
  6. Cleaning my apartment toilet without flinching.
  7. Budgeting.
  8. [GTD-ing my email inbox](http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/525491277/geek-brief.html).
  9. Discipling the tightest bunch of bros.
  10. Having a conversation about the inner workings of the once-mythical GameShark, mythical no more (innocence stripped by CS classes).
  11. Knowing friends who are starting companies and more friends who are [doing good in the world](http://www.gumballcapital.org/).
  12. Building solid relationships in my small group with married folks, working folks, family folks.
  13. Getting excited about Web development and how it might play into my work in the near future.
  14. Working on [WeJoinIn](http://www.wejoinin.com) with [Hsiu-Fan](http://hsiufan.eats.porkbuns.net) and thinking about how to take this baby out of the nest and onto the Web.  

  15. We started high school seven years ago.  

  16. Being challenged to dream ten years into the future.  


### Here's a question:

Were you ever one of those kids who knew exactly what you wanted to be when you grew up? (It doesn't matter whether you actually followed through!) Where are you now, and are you happy with it?
