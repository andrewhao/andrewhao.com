so there's 24-7 prayer going on this week here at UC Berkeley

**I. This morning around 4:15AM I realized**
I really don't believe that, put simply, Jesus is enough. It's not that simple, I said. "Why not?" Well, because isn't there supposed to be this rush of euphoria, visions of Heaven, and The Booming Voice. "Yes, but sometimes I'm a whisper." When am I going to stop secondguessing myself and explaining away things via Psychology and neurological chemical balances? "When you have faith." Dang, that's circular, God. "I know. That's faith."

"How about what I did for you on the cross?" Damn. "You are my beloved one."

**II. And followed in a half hour by the terrible urge to stand up and yell**


# THIS IS SO MUCH MORE THAN RELIGION


because I have seen so much this week and I don't wanna shut up about it. Like, folks are coming out here and really meeting God and hearing His voice and getting visions and burdens and having this awesome list of prayers that are being answered. Everybody does it out of the overflow of their heart and their time, God sees it and meets us here. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS REAL.
