April is a crazy month. Last week I spent thirty hours slaving over a [semantic analyzer](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/sp08/hw/proj2-notes.html) for my [compilers class](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/sp08/). We didn't exactly get it working perfectly, but it's good enough.  But I'm also reminded how I will not miss these late nights in Soda Hall. Okay, maybe a little.

I totally enjoyed our Freshmen Retreat Off Campus, a little shindig the staff and senior class here at [Intervarsity](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ccf) put on for the freshmen class. We invited a group of freshmen in our fellowship out to Oakland for a weekend of [Acts](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2011;&version=47;) manuscript study and hangout time with our class. I led a seminar that went over the sexual struggles of Christian men and gave some principles to fight the battle with (we titled it "[Band of Brothers: The Man Seminar](http://blog.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/band-of-brothers-men-and-sexuality.pdf)" or succinctly, "The Man-inar"). It was rather healing; telling my story and finding rapport and even grace with other bros. Other fellow seniors led seminars ranging from time management to campus engagement to relationships to spiritual disciplines.

All in all, we definitely had a blast this week. We're glad the frosh enjoyed the weekend, and we definitely see tons of potential in their community.

Now that much of the craziness is over (just for now), I promise to start writing more. There's a lot I have to tell you about. If you haven't discovered it yet, I keep short updates of my life over on [my Twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/andrewhao). Think of it as a place where I just tell you inane details of my life ("I'm eating a cheeseburger!", "I can't believe my professor just called us twits!").

I also really, really, really miss design. I've got a few pieces I can't wait to show you all. And I have tons of photos to update. Egads, this is going to be fun.
