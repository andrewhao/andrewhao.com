I get through Tuesdays and Thursdays by looking forward to the little things:



	
  * The longboard ride to 9:30AM lecture in Stanley.

	
  * Prof. Papadmitrou's thickly accented stories and awesome outfits (few professors can rock a Rage Against the Machine tee with the iconic Che Guevara screenprint)

	
  * That full feeling of $4 TC Garden takeout, then promptly falling into a 20-minute deep sleep in CS188 lecture.

	
  * The longboard ride back home.
