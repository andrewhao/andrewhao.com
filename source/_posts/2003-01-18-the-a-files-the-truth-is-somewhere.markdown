all right.. i'm going to apologize for the lack of updates (since when do i apologize? =D)
since finals week.. it's been quite hectic. here's a little catchup:

my finals on monday and tuesday were... decent (with the exception of spanish and lit). the
night before spanish i spent all this time typing up my notes and memorizing rules and the
whatnot.. only to find that half the test was on the stuff i didnt review  :(

wednesday night was the night before calc and chem, so scott arranged a little chem study
session (my second) that started around.. 5:30 or so. we were studying until 7ish or so, when
hannah had to leave. since the rest of us had calc to do and dinner to eat we agreed to go home
and come back 9:30. so i went home and did my calc (half of it, anyways) and ate my dinner.
went back over to scott's at 9:30 or so. when i got to his front door, i saw the** first
harbinger of doom **of the night: christine (su) and hannah were just leaving to grab some
coffee. and the **second**: christine was driving.

anyways hannah came back a little pale faced (hey it happens when your life flashes before your
eyes) but i should stop ragging on christine. to make a long story short.. the caffeine
evidently didnt help any logical thinking and we all ended up realizing **a)** how weird we
were and** b)** how screwed we were.

got home all bleary-eyed at 3:30AM or so, my head reeling. i wanted to review notes but i just
conked out fully dressed on the bed until 7:45 that next morning when i went to school with
contacts still in, mathbook forgotten and hair all over the place.

i wont fill you in on the carnage that happened that day.. but probably have an idea.

i've also made a vow to myself not to talk about academics until monday, a vow which i have
broken about 25 times so far.

friday morning was the interdistrict prayer rally.. this was basically just a big prayer
meeting with different people from all different schools. awesome to see so many people - mtn
view, homestead, tino, MV.. and of course lynbrook. the rally was pretty intense and i gotta
say that God's gonna be moving like crazy. awesome.

we kinda hung out afterwards.. i resisted the urge to go check grades. went over to dorothy's
afterwards and got laughed at attempting to play DDR (but its all good :) ).

over to paul's after CIA and watched face/off - second time i've seen it and it was just as good. john travolta and nicholas cage should have won some sort of acting award (okay.. so most action-thrillers never win those sorts of things).

this morning i woke up at about 11AM and realized i had nothing to do that day :) that really felt good. went bballing with vinny, ed, jack and tombo and we played the same jr highers.. lol that was a lot of fun. one of these days we will dunk on those rims.

i actually cleaned my room today. well.. halfway, anyways. so clean! sorry for boring you if you've gotten so far.. congratulate yourselves! take it easy everyone and slack on =D
