something is seriously wrong inside upside my head. last night i kept telling myself i'd get around to math homework. i'd start it sometime soon. _soon _was the key word.

to make a long story short, i never did it. i didnt do any homework last night. and i had a pretty sizeable amount last night. what's wrong with this picture?

where does my time go? why can't i stay **concentrated **and stay **on task **like everyone else? bah.. oh well..

helped out at the school library thursday for link crew. we leaders were supposed to show up and help the freshmen who were supposed to show up and study for finals. well.. i'd say about 3 freshmen showed up. and 3 of us leaders showed up. lol... either our frosh are super smart or they're scared of link crew leaders.

but yeah.. the six of us had a good conversation.. tony xu and kristen potter have got to be two of the most genuine people i've met. awesome.

played bball at country lane with the CCIC guys.. i think it's a good way to get back in shape, eh? definitely a good way to unwind after a long week.

afterwards yip, ed and i went to le select.. man PMT these days is more expensive than i remembered it used to be. hehe.. it's been like my 4th time EVER going out to buy PMT. the rest of the time my mom tries to make it, but the pearls just come out a little different than expected. but sall good. tasted good.

was talking to eunice today @ CIA and the christian club at los altos is going through some really tough times.. a lot of personal issues and drama between members. its so sad because just a year ago the club seemed to be on the right track and doing the right thing.. and so many issues have come up in such a short time. if God could only bring healing again to their club..

anyways.. i'm dog tired. gonna sleep like a baby tonight, which i'm definitely looking forward to.

nite all.
