I mentioned earlier that I get pretty mad when people litter in the parking lot. For example, this showed up one morning a few days after we swept the entire lot:

So it's pretty easy to have a bad attitude about it when you're the one who has to clean up after them. And it's even worse when it feels like nobody in Oakland takes pride in the neighborhood.

But today I caught a glimpse of one of our neighbors sweeping our sidewalk on 3rd st. without asking. He crossed the street to pick up the paper plates, Coke bottles and cigarette butts that litter our side of the block.

That inspired me a lot and got me thinking. I wanna serve out of joy in keeping the neighborhood tidy. I'm glad to know that there are folks out there who take pride in how the community looks.
