yesterday was so great: i got home from track practice, ate dinner and promptly slept from 8PM to 7AM.

now that presents me the problem of finishing both last night's homework and tonight's homework and getting tomorrow's homework done between now and 7AM.

this is so bad..

but before i started my homework this morning, i did remember to write my mom her birthday card.. so i was pretty proud to have my priorities straight.

gosh, forget about reading that. i'm boring.

anyways today's meet versus los gatos was pretty cool.. the vikes sweep all four divisions (so i hear) meaning only one thing:

**LHS TRACK IS OFF THE HOOK!**

yeah.. only problem is that now we're so good and have so many good people, i'm starting to become obsolete. today, i played no role in scoring points. hear that? zero. i might as well not exist. well, maybe as a cheerleader.

i did manage to tie my PR time of 2:20 in the 800.. but since so many people were PRing i was kind of expecting more. gah.. i really want to hit the 2:15s sometime in the next few meets but to do that i need a kick. it's so frustrating to be running the last 150m and seeing people pass by you like it's nothing. and you're just running there trying to stay at the same speed, if not slow down. not only frustrating, but humiliating.

but in the grand scheme of things, LHS track and field is back in the business. back in the _winning_ business, and hey, i can't complain :)
