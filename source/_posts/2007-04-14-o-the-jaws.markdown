In the past 36 hours I've become a better man (tongue firmly in cheek). I've learned about teamwork, gained a new view on loyalty, watch my pride goeth-ing before my fall, skirted the limits of human capabilities and wakefulness, meditated on Grace & the Big Picture, been a victim of my own blind arrogance, winced at the pained cries of my classmates at their lab stations and laughed hard at the dumbest jokes I've ever heard in my life (but at 6AM, they can be real funny).  
  
"We belong here.."  
  
"..like a baby in a mother's womb."
