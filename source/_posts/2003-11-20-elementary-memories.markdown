may i brag? **"Can-Do School"** i.e. All Your Nerds Are Belong To Us

yeah, we faria nerds everywhere swell with pride. strange thing is that when i was there.. i sure didn't think that anyone was exceptionally smart (except maybe tiankai liu). and i don't think we were.. maybe it was just the atmosphere? who knows.

i wonder sometimes where my old elementary classmates are. gosh.. i only keep in touch with a few of them (besides the lynbrook crew). i dont know if i could ever recognize them again. and maybe that's a good thing.

we promised ourselves a reunion (yeah, we being sixth graders). and thinking back on it, it seemed so foolish standing there and promising ourselves that we would once meet again and somehow retain some of our sixth-grade personas, six years down the road.
