I was sitting under the alcove of the Bear Market today trying to do some devos and not get rained on (you know those gusts that bring sideways rain...). Ten minutes in I found myself half-daydreaming-half-people-watching: people with umbrellas out, collars tucked in, jackets pulled in tight.

"See how much I love them."

The thought flashed across my mind again. And they kept passing, hands holding the breath close to their faces, sidestepping puddles, talking on cell phones, tracking puddles into storefronts. The ones dressed in sandals, shorts and only a sweatshirt looked the most miserable.

"See how Beautiful they are?"

To be honest, God, I don't. I just see students. People. Friends, enemies. Stereotypes. Categories.

"I created them. I love them."

Help me see.





I saw it in: A smile. A cup of roasted coffee. A couple holding hands. Rain. Fresh air. Laughter between friends. Life.

"I gave those to them. That's how much I love them."

Pastor Dennis once told us, "I love rain because it's a reminder of God's grace falling on the saved and the unsaved."

I walked extra slow today to class (yeah, I've also got a bum ankle, but that's beside the point), taking it all in.

"They're all worth it. They're worth my Son."

Yeah, yeah, we are.

Hey hey hey, I need to thank some folks:

**Mike Lee**, who basically went outta his way to check out a book from the UCLA library, take photos of them and send them to me because I was stressing about not being to find it at the UCB library for this crazygonuts history paper I have.

**Folks who ask** "How are you doing" and listen and pray for me. IV community, roommate Mike, Jeremy Lee and (hopefully in the future), Mosaic.

**Matt Kwok** who I hope doesn't read this. But I really appreciate getting to know him this year (I look up to this guy).
