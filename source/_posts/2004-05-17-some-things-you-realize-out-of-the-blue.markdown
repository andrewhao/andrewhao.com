today i realized that i really cannot do computer science for a living. or maybe i'm just doing this wrong. so what am I really meant to do? God i need some guidance here.

"we were meant to live for so much more -- have we lost ourselves?"

something changed in my heart after the DYC vigil, and i think the dissatisfaction with the things that I originally wanted gave me a thirst for something better something bigger and something MORE.
