tell me how you do it, all of you i saw again this week. tell me how, after the handshake and the hug and all the formalities we'll compare notes; i'll tell you how my butt's getting kicked, yall will look me in the eye and tell me "i love what i'm doing."

the idea of a career scares me. the idea of me being in control of my future scares me more. the idea of screwing up four years, 80 grand plus of my parent's money gone studying something that just might siphon my soul scares me the most.

God, I need some direction, and I need it fast.
