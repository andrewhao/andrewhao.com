"you're eating at the computer again?" my dad asked me today, "you need to relax while you eat." and i wish i could, dad.

my parents have recently started to worry about my health. you know, the normal stuff... eating enough vitamins, constant reminders to go to sleep early, the occasional reminder to take it easy in track.

"your stomach needs blood to digest. when you think and eat at the same time, the blood goes to your brain," he stated, matter-of-factly.

matter-of-fact may be a good thing in this current circumstance. i'm starting to worry about my body too. today while running my workout, i came across the horrible thought: _what if i never grow again?_ i'm awake throughout the "growing hours" of 10PM-2AM, i'm a runner (extra stress on the spinal cord) and other various strange reasons came to mind. what if i'm doomed to be 5'6" the rest of my life?

but i digress. the point is that my mom's worried, my dad's worried, and most of all, I'M WORRIED... about my parents, that is. i'm not sure if it's the natural thing to do, to start fussing and fretting over your children as time goes by. if my mom and dad are going to grow grey hairs, **i don't want it to be over me.**

valentine's day today at school was pretty amusing.. good times teasing alex choy with his heart balloon (oo la la =D) and with garrick moaning "where's my superficial love? how come i dont have any superficial love?" hahah hilarious..

if you've come expecting to read a depressing valentine's day entry, then you can quit right here.

there's so much discontent with being single, feelings of depression and a really low self esteem are so prevalent around this time of the year. there's a lot of heartbreak and old wounds being reopened.. and to those of you guys who are really suffering all i can give is a heartfelt "i'm sorry".

honestly, i've lived quite the sheltered life. no major hardships or obstacles.. no major heartbreak. i guess i've learned to prevent others from getting too close to me because if there's one thing i can't take, it's heartbreak. and since we're all humans, it's inevitable that of of us is going to fail the other. that's why i'm waiting for God's plan.. the best one for me.. a God who understands how you're feeling and whispers assurances in your ear that he alone knows who's best for you.

and so i wait.
