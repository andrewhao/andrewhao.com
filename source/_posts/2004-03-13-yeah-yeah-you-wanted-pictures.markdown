praise night last night was pretty crazy.. thomas gave a message talking about the holiness of God and just being in his throneroom and that once you realize that, how can you not give your all? there was a change in the atmosphere in the room.. it was crazy Holy Spirit conviction dude. anyways i'm just praying that this change isn't temporary.. God, change this group. the air's stale, come through again like a wind, we're gonna breathe again.
