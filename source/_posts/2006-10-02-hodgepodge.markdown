Physically speaking, I'm completely better. Thanks for the prayers and cough drops, guys. It feels good to have a clear throat and clear head. On the minus side, Charles is sick (thanks to me). So pray for him too (I feel hecka bad... he's moaning and coughing in bed right now).  
  
Themes in my life lately: humility, faith, brokenness. (needing more-, growing in-, understanding-)  
  
I've been trying to understand this 239423-dimensional agape love of the Father and really understanding how feeble my own love is. How is it possible to love like You did? Lately I'm having so much trouble distilling my emotions from my motivations from good ol' truth. How could you have loved so intensely, so personally, so universally? I don't understand it. I'm so imperfect.  
  
I am going nowhere in particular with this post.  
  
I kind of miss feeling. Berkeley + busyness has done it. Am I numb? Spiritually, emotionally? I'm just a little weary.  
  
There was swing dancing under Sather Gate on Friday. The atmosphere was just right. The gate was lit (save for the bulb on the far end), the music was pleasant and there was this energetic vibe. Folks started clapping along to the music and I couldn't help but smile.  
  
I feel like I'm returning to that dry place I was at last semester, but it's not the same place. Sure, it's filled with uncertainty, but it's no longer lonely; it's replaced with a confident trust in the Father that He will lead me out again. Ps.23  
  
I love fall in Berkeley. Just minus the rain.  
  
CS projects are eating up my life. I have about 3-4 meetings a week, each between an hour and five hours long. The worst part? It hasn't even gotten bad yet.  
  
I can trust I can trust I can trust. Solid rock.  
  
I saw Mike again for the first time in three weeks -- twice. First in front of Asian Ghetto, the second in front of Fat Slice. He's been interviewing for jobs, but none of them have panned out. "I like to put a smile on people's faces" he tells me. "Cash, check, credit card?" he calls out to passerbys. They look down at their shoes. "No change!" he finishes, and they chuckle. One lady turns around and gives him the sweetest smile.   
  
"Andrew, come see me again," he calls out to me after we share a meal. It is my first realization that we are friends.  
  
I want to write, but everything's been said.
