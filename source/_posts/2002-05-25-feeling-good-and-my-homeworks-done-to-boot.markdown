sooo.. i got my full 8 hours of sleep this morning.. man it felt so great rolling out of bed and having to do NOTHING

well, okay. close to nothing. dragged myself over to deanza college to take the "calculus readiness test" to see if i'm ready for math 1A. wasnt a horrible test, was fine and blah blah blah.

i went over to korean baptist church tonight for their praise concert. **lincoln brewster** played there.. i think he played at Creation West and also opened for Michael W. Smith too.. wow.. he's an amazing guitarist who's got a crazy passion for god. im thinking that this was a really good experience for me.. took some time to reevaluate my relationship with god. cuz i realized it wasnt going anywhere and i guess i needed something to jumpstart it. you know.. i'd like you guys to pray for me to be able to go deeper in my walk.

it's kinda like a mountain climber who knows that when he hits the peak he's gonna get a rush like he's never felt before, but the problem is that everything keeps pulling him down that mountain.. thats kinda how i'm feeling right now..

gonna spend tomorrow afternoon at the car wash.. maybe i'll go get a haircut (been needing one for awhile =P).. and probably go study some IIC math. woohoooo...
