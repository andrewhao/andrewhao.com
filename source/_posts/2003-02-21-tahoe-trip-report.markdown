a few hours back from the tahoe trip and man.. i am pooped. three days of pigging out, hanging out and just basically having a good ol time  :)

so the seven of us (pastors thomas and peter, jack, vinny, jimmy, andrew yip and i) load up on two cars and begin our journey up to tahoe. and oh yeah. my camera erased its own memory while i was changing the batteries so i have (almost) no pictures to show. at least not until i get photos from the other guys  :cry:

so the trip up consists of peter ditching us in his audi while "thomas' little car that could" chugged happily along. after about 4.5 hours of loud music, bad singing and thomas' random outbursts of "awwright-ha!", we end up at humphrey and bonnie's (they're a family from our church) condo way up near the heavenly ski resort. the night is late and we unpack and are quickly knocked unconscious.

the next day, we hit the slopes. jimmy boasts about how he can bomb down those double black diamonds on the snowboard with ease. _uh.. doesn't that mean knowing how to snowboard first?_ right.

so vinny, jack, and jimmy go off to take snowboard lessons while andrew yip, thomas, peter, humphrey and i head up heavenly to take on the mountain. man.. heavenly is **huge**  8O i mean, it required about 25-30 minutes to get from the base lodge up to the top of the mountain on the lifts alone. needless to say, the slopes were awesome but tagging along with peter and humphrey really scared the heck out of me.

i like to think of myself as someone who doesn't like to take risks. you know.. **i don't wanna die** 8O  meanwhile, peter and humphrey are going tree skiing.. doing the jumps at the snowboard park and the such. i had a pretty interesting time going down the moguls.. aye.. those really give me nightmares. i kept running worst case scenarios through my head.. what would happen if i landed wrong... if my knees got twisted all weird.. if they had to bring me down in a sled dragged by a snowmobile.. hey i'm too young to die! :(

but needless to say, i survived and everybody else did too. we went to this pizza parlor place for dinner where we ordered five pizzas that we could not finish.. so we ended up finishing that for dinner, midnight snack, breakfast AND lunch the next day  8) good stuff..

we spent the next day just hanging around the condo with bonnie and baby zachary (cutest baby i've seen) while peter, humphrey and thomas headed off for the slopes again. i actually got some homework done.. amazing, no? while we were up there we had a gamecube and an xbox with us.. so you can guess what occupied a large amount of our time  :) but yeah.. it was really awesome just being able to hang out and talk.. sleep and relax and just really think. the adults come back and we head out for the horizon casino to pig out at their buffet. man.. anything you want to eat, it's there. let's just say i have a lot of catching up to do in track. hung around afterwards at the arcades there.. had a lot of fun. alright-hah  :)

had to leave early friday morning.. what a shame  :( peter finally got his punishment for driving so fast when he hit a large rock sitting in the middle of the road, popping his rear tire. haahha.. we had a lot of fun teasing him about that. had to call up the AAA truck to help us out. but you know what.. in the end we all got home in one piece, safe and sound and with a lot of good memories. and that's what matters, right?

here's what little photos i was able to snap on the way home.. after my batteries ran out on me.
