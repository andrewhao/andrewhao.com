hey guys.. i dont want to make this a depressing entry or anything but i really feel that i need some **prayer**. lately my heart's been feeling really heavy.. seems as if all my anxieties and fears have been dug up again.. and i'm just feeling so overwhelmed. feels like everything.. all my plans and expectations and views that once were so stable and established are starting to come apart. i don't think that it's just coincidence that all this stuff is happening all at once.. there's so many things to blame (myself included). but to my family in Christ - i just really need your prayers.

_God.. why does my heart feel so heavy? it feels like i'm carrying so much burden.. i don't know if it's a burden from You or if they're just my own anxieties. GOd.. you care so much about me yet i'm always feeling like i'm never good enough.. i'm always failing somehow. and i know it's killing You.. **but you always pick me right back up again**. seems as if everything that i thought You wanted, that i thought You had a plan for is in turmoil. who am i to ask.. who am i to question? **truth is you never lost control. **so take control of me, over those that You care for. show Your power... show us once again that You're in control.
