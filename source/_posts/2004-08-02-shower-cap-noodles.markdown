i used to write so much in this thing. what happened.. either i got lazy or my life got that much more boring. dot dot dot...

i'm too sheltered. i don't think that can be emphasized enough. definitely a mixed blessing, but sometimes i feel like if only i went through a bit more i'd appreciate and hold onto and be desperate for the things i take for granted right now.

blah, ever since Vertigo ended my writing's gone down the drain. i need to start reading again.

_while we were hanging today at Wendy's_
priscilla: "you know why i like our class? because we don't eat at expensive restaurants." dollar menu, baby.

i like writing in blurbs.

ever have that fear that on the first day of school you're doing something wrong, such as you got your classrooms mixed up or your boxers are showing or you're not wearing deodorant. then you'd be famous for a long time afterward, and people would say "hey, there's that idiot who showed up in the wrong class" or "hey there's the boxer guy who smells real bad." that would be terrible. still, at least you'd be famous.

on the same humorous slant, i remember when i started talking to girls -- on AIM (face to face? no way.) i can remember when, too: September 2000, when i'd get home from school and breathlessly sign on and then send a "hey!" to a cute girl i knew from class and then my heart would be pounding and my fingers shaking waiting for her to reply. here's how it went.

me: hey!
her: hi
(here i pause and try to think of something witty & heartwarming to say.)
me: how was your day?
her: ...

if i ever got a response past that point, my existence on Earth was validated. sometimes i'd be sneaky and replace it with "what was math homework tonight?" when i knew the assignment was already. yeah, that was my crafty ninth grade brain at work. AIM gives you training wheels for real life social situations so you know what works and what doesn't.  and i learned that sometimes it's better to just shut up around girls, cuz whatever you say (or type) is gonna sound stupid anyways. hah, who said that chatting has no redeemable value?

sleep before 2. sleep before 2. you're gonna microwave your brains if you don't.
