Christians believe in a spiritual dimension to everyday life. It's mostly invisible and occasionally tangible. It's described in Scripture as a war between God and Anti-God, where humanity is caught in between the warring sides.

On that note, Satan sucks.

Everybody's catching flak. There's been a lot of suffering, and a lot of loss. I've felt a lot of despair, and I'm not alone. There are relationships being torn apart. There's weariness, resurfacing addictions, brokenness...

It's also mentioned in Scripture that [the Divine has all authority over Anti-God](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:10-18;&version=31;), and in the end, it trumps all. It is Good, it is overwhelmingly beautiful, it promises a superior pleasure and joy.

I've [briefly mentioned](http://blog.andrewhao.com/2007/11/27/on-manhood-mission/) this, these are the times to [fight for joy](http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Articles/ByDate/1995/1539_How_Shall_We_Fight_for_Joy/). These are the times to pray hard with many tears. These are the times to cling on to the [hope that does not disappoint](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%205:5;&version=31;).
