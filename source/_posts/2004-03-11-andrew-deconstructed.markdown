you know those energy drinks that seem to be all the rage? you know, red bull, AMP, bawls, et cetera? well today i drank one for the first time, and i felt like i was cheating. like a pro athelete on designer steroids (only it was super sugared water).

forgive me, i needed to stay up to study for a bio test (which i should be doing right now). but gosh, i couldn't help but think how i've been destroying my body lately.

1) STILL not enough sleep
2) when i do, it's on hardwood floor in a sleeping bag right beneath my desk
3) sprained left ankle (healing!)
4) inflamed right arch (healing!)
5) shin splints (both ankles kinda healing)
6) eating dinner daily at 10PM, then sleeping on a full stomach (recipe for gastrointestinal problems)
7) skipping lunch (never on purpose)
8) fast food death wish (how can i refuse a good dollar menu?!)

and now,
9) caffeinated energy drinks. what's next?!

track meet today was pretty terrible for me, but i suppose if i keep thinking of every meet in terms of numbers i'll always end up discouraged. it's okay, i'll improve, i tell myself. i'll run my butt off (more) in practices. i'll (try) not to screw up any other part of my body. for reals.

i can't help but hear my dad's voice in my head. "you know, nobody's perfect, andrew. you don't have to try so hard."

but it'd sure be nice. maybe that's one of my character flaws - i can't accept mediocrity. by the end of this season, i'm sure i will  :!:

okay, no more semi-witty statements nobody can understand except myself. i'm out like a ectoderm germ layer.
