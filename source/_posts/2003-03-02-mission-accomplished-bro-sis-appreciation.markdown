all right.. so now that the whole deal's done and over with, we can finally tell details about this whole operation.

so the soph/junior guys were assigned the monumental and probably nearly impossible task of coming up with a gesture of appreciation for the soph/junior girls.. now keep in mind that we're the same no-hope, smart-aleck immature kind of guys we were years ago  :) naw.. but anyways last week the girls put on a picnic for us.. then we vowed to do something in return that would be hard to top.

so we figured.. hey.. why not a dinner? make it semiformal and with candles and music and stuff like that. but should we cook the food? isn't that **dangerous**? heck, isn't that **deadly**?

then to complicate matters even more, we made these awesome little booklets (sorry if i sound like i'm bragging, i'm just so proud of these guys  :) ) that had life situations and their corresponding bible verses.. then on the back would be a little personal message to each girl saying what we appreciated about em. i've got to say that david luoh and andrew yip really hooked us up with these.. the guys spent crazy time and effort on them and it showed.

but yeah.. to sum it all up, we spent the entire day today in preparation.. bringing the chairs and tables from church, cooking up some food (props to solomon wang with the cookies, leslie/david with the casserole and jack (ahem) with the spaghetti), doing some heavy lifting of furniture and stereo equipment and the like. (i wish i had pictures right now, but i think i lost my digital camera  :cry:) props especially to jack here for organizing the setup/cleanup.

the menu @ Mr. <strike>C</strike>Hao's:
1. appetizers (salad + garlic bread)
2. pasta alfredo
3. chicken casserole
4. spaghetti
5. dessert (cookies + ice cream cake)

but yeah.. in the end the atmosphere of the place was really nice. the girls had a good time, a good dinner (they were amazed.. ya better believe it) and hopefully felt appreciated.. cuz they better have :?  :)

good job guys.. i'm **seriously pretty proud **of you guys for pulling it all together. might've seemed impossible at first but here we are  :)  good stuff, guys. yall make me proud  8)

joe: "man, i was there and nobody died of food poisoning, i didnt break any dishes and nothing burned!"

pastor peter: "you guys pulling all this off.. you know this is some freak accident right?" (referring to the fact that nothing blew up)
