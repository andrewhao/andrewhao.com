anyways.. i've been coughing my head off for the past three days or so. marching band.. (shakes head). half the band is sick, it's raining and napa will no doubt be a mudfield. what could be worse?!

but lynbrook mb will always pull through (mostly cuz no field could be as bad as ours  :) ) i really hope that we can pull off the "performance of our lives" that night. gotta get everybody pumped.

guy's lock-in at CIA tongiht.. we got a ton of things planned. yes.. 50 guys, 3 church floors, mucho ramen noodles and halloween candy, 4 Xboxes and 16 controllers, 5 TVs, 1 DVD player, 2 camcorders and stereos. this will be awesome. looking foward to it.

gotta shower now.. i'll be back on sunday.
