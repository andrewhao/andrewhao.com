okay i'm gonna ramble:

i've been majorly stressed lately, but God's been good to me.. i dunno but i've been shown so much mercy and there's just been crazy stuff that proves He's still there caring for me.

and yet i'm still craving more cuz i've always felt a need to sit still and just listen to God's voice. there was just a period after summer that i lost it through the static of my activities and committments. today i felt a little tug telling me maybe it was time to start again.

i've been worshipping with the jason upton CD recently. it's amazing cuz when he worships, every word testifies that he's in **direct contact **with God and His presence. and when i'm listening to him worship, i'm drawn along into God's presence too. it's been a major blessing to me.

a bunch of the college crew came back on friday (most for MV homecoming). it was good getting to see them all again and hear their crazy dorm stories and adventures on campus. so many of them have changed.. man i feel like i'm getting obsolete, like this part of their lives is left in the past. but they've moved on, and i guess it's a part of life =/ man what happens when we go to college? how are we gonna change? and as life changes, are we gonna forget the past? scary stuff to think about.

continuing my rambling, thursday was the cross country meet (second crystal springs of the year). in my humble opinion, it was so much better than the first because a) i wasn't too hurt and b) i actually slept the night before. it felt really good the first mile or so, but the second mile was crap. my problem is that i start slow and crank it up as i go along the race. i should be cranking more but i just can't do it. it's so true when they say that running's psychological cuz **i listen to pain too much**. if i want to keep up with the varsity top dogs, i gotta learn to push past those mental barriers.

on the other hand, the cross country team has bonded very well and it's starting to feel like family. almost, but hey it's close :D

and finally ending the rambling, this saturday was my last foothill band review competition. oh man, where has the time gone? seems like last week that i was standing by, waiting out there in the pouring rain in a poncho that couldnt keep out any water for monica to march us onto the field. and lynn chen (i wonder how you're doing now?) my fellow crate-tugger just grinned at me through the dripping water and gave me a hug and a high five for good luck. man i still remember heading back early for homecoming, not going to homecoming, eating togos in a portable band room and slowly drying off with the heat of 160 people fogging the bandroom windows. three years and three field shows later, here i am at that same field on the same astroturf.

yeah.. it was unreal because as soon as i stepped off that field i knew that it would be the last time i'd be on. something about that struck me, and i'm realizing that my high school career is almost over. i caught myself wishing that the show could have been better. something about myself wanted the storybook ending that could close that "foothill comp" chapter in my marching band career.

but it's already closed, that show's been marched. what am i going to remember it by? the laughter, the camraderie, everything else. and hey, let's make lodi next week even better. i'm excited :D

stanford app is due next week and ohhhhhhhhhcrud can you say **"essay du crap"?!!** i got my first drafts back from mrs. mcsherry and oh goodness, they were **murdered**. thanks for the wakeup call, i think i'm going to rewrite. and cry a little.

anyways, this was the required rambling for the week. i was going to head out and run a little bit but i figure all this typing more than equates it :D slacker.
