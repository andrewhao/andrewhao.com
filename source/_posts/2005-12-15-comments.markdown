finals week has taken a lot more outta me than i thought it would. see you on the other side.

now is the time to eat all the perishables in our refrigerator. the problem is that we'd be eating eggs, broccoli and ketchup for the next three days.

there is something to be said for sleeping early and waking early. ben franklin is mah boy.

yesterday, andy yang and i spent +10 hours studying physics. 8 of those hours were spent at crossroads, from lunch till dinner. lame electromagnetism joke here, please.

hooray for competence!
