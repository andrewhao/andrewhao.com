For maybe the past two weeks God has been weaving and speaking a very specific message to me. Every conversation, prayer, sermon, event, class and encounter is all wrapped up into this. Oh my God. I need maybe another week to process this. Incredible. Mind-blowing. Face-meltingly humbling.  
  
I won't use the word "life-changing"ï¿½yet, but I think certain assumptions in my walk are being challenged and for the first time I realize I can't skirt the infinitely excellent paradoxes of God. It's time I manned up and face the question of personal holiness in light of a holy God, it's time I opened my eyes to the brokenness of community and faced the challenge of offering a human-grace on behalf of a divine-grace so perfect I have only cracked open the first layer.

Yesterday's Oregon game freakin' rocked (we dominated 45-24, and moved up to #10). Times like these I am absolutely unabashedly proud of my school. Fun moment: watching Nobel Prize-winning physics prof George Smoot lead cheers and standing up and screaming at the top of my lungs, "I LOOVE PHYSICS!" And nobody shot me any dirty looks.

I looked up from my desk tonight and had a Geek Moment.
