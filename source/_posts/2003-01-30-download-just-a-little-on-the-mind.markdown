all right.. i'm pretty excited. CCLR (christian club leadership retreat) is this weekend and i'm really looking forward to it, not only in terms of what sort of fun i'll have or people i'll meet, but also in terms of what God's gonna bust out. only downside is that i'll have to bring my homework along.. a small sacrifice -_-

seems like half the team ditched today (well it's only preseason).. only the dedicated hardcore group was left over (or they were freshmen). haha yea that's right.. hank had everybody run distance, and i love to see us distance runners kick butt. when it comes to distance, that is. ahha we pride ourselves in doing everything well. (said to a sprinter) "so, you've finally graduated to being one of us?"

my will broke down and i made a stop to jack-in-the-box after practice. it was only a 99cent chili burger! please, don't guilt trip me.. i didnt eat (much) lunch!

got home and got (some) homework done.. left to go help set up the black light rally for tomorrow. i've gotta say.. we juniors have a lot of things left to get done. yeesh.. i guess we did our best.

if you're a junior, you've really gotta give props to your officers cuz they've gone through a lot this year, whether it be planning, fundraising, junior prom headaches, homecoming (especially) and even activities like rallies.. you guys have no idea how much flak, drama, stress and tension they go through. so give em a hug next time you see one.

anyways.. i'll be gone for much of the weekend. wow.. i'm pretty excited. i'll post sometime after i get back. till then,
