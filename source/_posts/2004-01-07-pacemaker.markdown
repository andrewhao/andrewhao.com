**i still think i'm superman**. i still think i can bust out into super-student mode and take care of whatever i need to do, never mind sleep (that's for wimps!)

so the past few days have found me and my poor face plastered across my AP English and AP Bio and AP Whatever books a wee few minutes before school starts. whatever made me think i was superhuman?

"you're still overcommitting yourself" my youth pastor tells me. "you need to cut some activities," my mom tells me. "i can still do this," my naive brain tells me.

"you fool," my body told me this morning as i got up to work at 3AM. i agreed, and crawled back into the covers after silencing three alarm clocks.

i'm pooped. i can't do this on my own. i gotta get my priorities straight. what follows is really for me, to unload my thoughts at the moment. thanks  8O

-------------------------------

**music man** pit orchestra is going to be huge time committment. talk about sacrifice. i've really been excited about getting back to doing music after break ended, but i never expected music man to be this difficult for me. yeah, so doc's yelling at me to play out, but how can i do that if every other run is wrong? dangit, andrew, time to get practicing.

**all county band** auditions are on friday, i've yet to get my act together. i'm not sure what i'm doing it for. the prestige? honor? perhaps some validity as a clarinet player in doc's eyes? i haven't prepped my solo piece enough, i'm not sure if its worth all that trouble. and secretly, i'm afraid of validation of my worst fear named Truthfully, Andrew, You Suck. my lips are dying already from so much clarinet practice this week. mike and i were joking about how our lips would be bleeding at the end of the week. we were half joking.

**vertigo production** is taking up afterschool time. but my is it fun. and stressful at times too. fortunately we should be done in another week or so, i'm excited.

**de anza math 1C** is gonna kill me. the professor moves through the material **fast**. he's on the next subject before you can say "differential-_wha?_" fortunately a couple of buddies are in that class to keep me awake. slightly.

sigh, i need to learn self-discipline. bad study habits die hard.

**track practice** is out of the question for the next two weeks. i need to sacrifice it (and my body) to get everything done first.

**we wanna see **agape become so much more than just a hangout place. its gotta be a place where intense faith is lived out.. where members find fellowship and real accountability with each other. we've never been able to do that.. but i'm kind of excited cuz we're starting to take a couple of steps in that direction. man, crazy stuff would happen if we started living stuff like that out.

be real to me, God. i'm needing You more than ever.
