man.. it's almost the end of the year and i've decided that i've got to stop and really re-evaluate myself in certain areas.

**Academics**: this year's been pretty hard on me.. not necessarily because of my workload but because of my attitude and approach to academics - sometimes i dont have that work ethic and drive that's required to succeed and i'm always kicking myself for that. i'm often one of the last few people online in the wee hours of the morning and you know why? it's cuz i keep procrastinating  :(  you be horrible andrew.. you be horrible.

that isnt to say i've been a total failure.. but there are a lot of times where i could have tried so much harder and with better results. i'm totally glad my parents dont really pressure me about academics. they just care that i'm putting 100% effort into whatever i'm doing. and i've been failing them in that area.

**Family**: sort of drifted away from my parents this year.. partially due to the car and the freedom it now gives me. yeah.. i think having htat freedom is totally awesome but sometimes i guess i should be spending that time with my family. my mom and dad are pretty cool.. very understanding and very patient. my mom's always hardworking and always wears a smile while my dad's always joking with my sisters and telling me not to work too hard. as for me and my sisters.. i'm getting the feeling that we're kinda understanding each other a little better.

**Me**: i know that many people see me as always happy and always friendly - that's the image i always try to project. but sometimes i'm just too down or too tired to try to hold up a facade.. i wanna be real to everybody you know? i wanna be authentic. problem is that i'm not even sure who the real me is.. i guess we're all kind of searching in a way. which kind of leads me into:

**Friends**: i've got to say that this school semester's really been trying on my friends.. i've been so occupied with academics or some activities that i've never had the proper time to connect with them and spend time with them. sometimes i've never gotten past the superficial with a lot of my friends. there was that quote: "a friend of everybody is a friend to no one". and now that i think about it.. that really does apply to me. i try to make as many contacts and acquaintances as possible (why? to appear friendly? to be popular??) but i've never gotten below surface level with a lot of them.. people at school especially. sometimes even at church. isnt that so hypocritical? these people i call my brothers and sisters in Christ.. and i can't even bring up personal subjects with them. sometimes i see myself as a failure because so many of my friendships are shallow. and that's pretty universal with a lot of people i see at school today.. it's such a sad thing. to the people who've really made the effort to connect with me - you guys got my love and i'm totally thankful to God that i've got people like you =P

**Girls:** ah.. woman. that confusing human being that we guys have never and probably can never figure out =D but yeah.. this is a pretty personal subject for me and right now i'm pretty confused in this area. sometimes i wonder if what i want is what God wants for me in this area. and sometimes i wonder if what my perception of what love is right now is going to change as i grow and mature.

**God**: it's really been a rollercoaster ride for me this year.. from the total spiritual highs i've been on in the beginning of the year and from summer retreat to the lows i've been getting from school and stress and my personal failures. i've made it a point to myself to make myself live out my life like Jesus would.. to be unashamed of what He's done in my life but i definitely know that i've really failed so many times. i apologize to you if i havent lived myself out the way that you'd expect a christian to.. and i give major thanks to God for always taking me back.

lately i've been more in the 'down' phase and feeling kinda empty.. _I need more of Your love_.. cuz that's all that needs to be explained.


whoops, did you wanna know how my day was?  :)  :)

woke up at about.. 12 (yeah horrible sleep habits i know). got myself together then headed out to miller for some final spanish project filming. then about 2:00 i went over to calabazas to get the chem started.. met up with benjy scott taimur and alex and we all tried to figure out the packet.. but we either a) goofed off or b) gave up. man.. this stuff aint cool.

stopped by the house for some money, then went out and bought junny's bday gift (gift certificate), then it was off to her house for our youth group junior-senior gathering. great stuff.. we ate a ton (esp those jelly bellies.. gotta love those) watched a movie, sat around and talked and played some games. left a lil early and sent back virginia and stephen.. then since i'm in kind of a contemplative mood... here i sit in front of the computer.

good enough? excellent. tomorrow will be productive, i assure you.
