i've noticed something about the way i wake up in the mornings. my alarm clock is set to go off at 6:25 and i hit the snooze button twice. there are 20 minute intervals between each snooze. so by then it's 7:05 and i'm still conked out on the bed and i feel like molasses. but then my mom comes running into the room (7:05 right on time) and yells "hurry andrew you're gonna be late!" now here comes the weird part. at the split second that she finishes her sentence i leap straight up into the air, throw back the covers and dash for the bathroom. isnt that weird? one moment i'm dead tired.. the other moment i'm scrambling like a madman.

anyways.. school today was pretty tedious as usual. i stayed up late last night checking email and generally wasting time online till 4AM.. that was stupid stupid stupid. now i've got a bunch of hw that i wish i'd finished earlier. tonight will really hurt.

on a separate topic, i was wondering what kind of effect we Christians were having on the lynbrook campus this year. every morning, daniel and seung (two of the most fired up Christians i've ever met!) get to school early and pray in the quad. man.. waking up early.. that's so tough for me and i rarely make it to the quad before first period starts. but these guys are so sincere in praying for lynbrook.. if you guys walk past these guys in the mornings, chances are they're praying for YOU. man.. God's really put a burden on their hearts and it's really touched me.

wednesday morning praise in the quad gathers a bit more of us. but yeah.. we've been hearing some complaints about it making some people uncomfortable because it does get a little loud. what does God want us to do? getting people a little uncomfortable may actually be a good thing.. but if it goes over the line, i dont think that's right. we're not supposed to be ashamed right? if God told us to get out there in the quad and pray.. then there's no reason to stop. yeah.. Satan isnt gonna be too happy about that and we've already seen some minor backlash. right now we're sorta praying that we really are doing God's will.. and we ask that God really take back this school.

xc practice was in the hills today. ouch.. one mile uphill warmup, then a three mile interval workout (all hills). then back down again. i hurt. a lot.

back to homework. but i will do my devos before the work. oh yeahhh..
