its getting so summerlike.. gosh i love getting out and feeling that sun and smelling that warm smell of moist grass. well.. up to a point.

summerlike weather also means being stuck inside the house.. means being stuck simmering in a room whose temperature rivals those of a grill. how did it get so hot so suddenly?

we invited mr barnett (our agape club advisor) to share today.. he had a lot of good stuff to say, a lot of wise insights. i think i was really surprised last year when we met with him to find that he was such a cool guy. i mean, you normally don't think of your teachers outside of their teaching personas, right? so i'd always considered him as just "mr barnett the PE teacher". but our weekly meetings with him on wednesdays this year has really heightened my respect for him and the fact that man, he's a cool guy.

my patience is really being tested these days with my sister.. i'm not going to badmouth her at all but it's definitely a trial sometimes to get through the day without having to endure some sort of emotional outburst. it's a struggle for me to just say "okay, she's my sis and i've still gotta respect her" and move on. and maybe it's the weather. i dunno. they say these things change with time, and i sure hope they do.

we're getting some spanish project filming done this afternoon, so i've gotta jet.
