It's Friday and the power on my block has gone out. My small group is gathered in my apartment just hanging out by candlelight, making fun of each other (the way it's supposed to be).

When we get up to leave, I bring a candle out into the hall to help everybody find their shoes.

"It's so bright," somebody remarks. And it's true, that one candle is throwing light far down the hall and around the corner.

"Darkness doesn't stand a chance," says my friend Emily.

Mm yeah. Darkness doesn't stand a chance.
