Shall be in Berkeley starting tomorrow. Taking Math 55 (Discrete) - 2 hours a day M-Fri... wah! The best/worst part is that I get to rush to the Berkeley BART right after class to catch the train to Fremont, and work until maybe 7PM, upon which I'll get back home at 8:30PM or so.  
  
I know I said this summer was going to be different, but it's starting to be a doozy! Lessee how far (I can) go.
