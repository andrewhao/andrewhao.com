well this ends a kinda hectic week for me.. it feels really good finally putting all this stuff to an end. i've got a pretty awesome weekend to look forward to. and i will type this up in a list format, cuz lists are cool.

1. youth for christ "direct connect": a sort of a seminar with several workshop for student leaders. daniel, robert, dorothy and I of agape are heading over there.. there's a lot of interesting stuff i really wanna go to and learn about. my own pastor (thomas chen) is running a workshop on drama (funny it should be that way cuz our drama ministry is putting on a....)

2. COMEDY IMPROV NIGHT - a very hardworking "Progress-O Drama Ministry" from our church is putting on a night where we'll just laugh our heads off. think of this as "whose line is it anyways" but with more people and more (no duh) talent. ahaha these guys always crack me up and i'm definitely looking forward to it.

3. computer's getting upgraded - well not really.. it's my dad's computer. but i'm still drooling. a nerd's fantasy. (drip drip fzzzt) he's gonna go out and buy the parts tomorrow and i guess we'll bond over some frustrating computer assembly (haha sounds so corny.. but it's true  :) )

4. sleep - 'nuff said.

anyways that's summarizing a pretty busy weekend. gotta get a move on now. post later.
