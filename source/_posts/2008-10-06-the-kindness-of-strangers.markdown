I like observing kindness demonstrated by strangers to other strangers.

Today at lunch, a couple walked by my table and let me know that I had dropped my wallet. Turns out it had fallen out of my pocket onto the ground. Small gesture, but it meant a lot to me.

I also like:



	
  1. Seeing students talking to homeless people, treating them with dignity.

	
  2. Good sportsmanship: guys calling fouls on themselves in pickup games.

	
  3. Strangers giving blind folks an arm to lead them in the right direction.
