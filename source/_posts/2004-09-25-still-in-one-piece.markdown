strangely enough, this week's been good after getting smacked down by one midterm and turning in a pretty ratty essay and feeling slightly lonesome holed up in my room coding programs at 2AM in the morning. not sure if i can explain why, but it just was.

mannn getting a phone call from home was just what i needed (after going through monday's academic spanking). dangit, why does my family rock.

so on tuesday i get major hunger pangs at 2AM. remembering my stash of premium udon ramen noodles, i break it out and realize to my dismay i have no hot water. so i figure i can just microwave some water???if i had a microwaveable container. well i don't, but i reason that heck, i'll just stick my plastic cereal bowl into the microwave and hope the water goes before the bowl does. add to that the fact that we have no extension cord for the microwave, i gingerly bring out the microwave into the hallway, pour water into the bowl and then hope for the best.

deutsch hall, floor 4, 2:00AM: there is a certain kid with polisci books sitting in the hall waiting for a microwave nuking a melting bowl of lukewarm water.

good noodles, but keep this up and i might die in six months.
