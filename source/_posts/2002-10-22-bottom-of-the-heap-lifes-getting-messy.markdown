so i was reading through some other random blogs online today.. and i've concluded that there are two types. the first is the deeply and carefully thought out blog with major time and effort placed towards the thought production. the second is the profanity-riddled, hate-spewing rarely updated blog. occasionally you will come across a hybrid of both, but that's usually the case.

and mine? i have no idea how to define it. hey.. this is me. and if i dont have anything deep or meaningful to say every day.. then i guess that's just how i am. simple huh?  :)

the computer sucks me in.. once i log onto AIM it's all over. that's a problem with me.. once i get online i'm stuck in an endless trap of things to do, profiles and blogs to update and emails to send and read. i turned this computer on at 9 and here i am at 12:30, with virtually no homework completed. this is getting really bad guys. really bad.

and plus to add to all that, my room, my computer desktop, my car is a MESS. it's not that i'm lazy, it's just that i have no time to clean up. and it really bugs me to see all this clutter.. one of these days.. when i have a free weekend.

looks like i'll have a free weekend soon.. or even a free weekday cuz it seems as if my shins will never heal.. aw man.  8O

i'm really insecure.. and the more i think about it, the more i realize how much it shows through my attitudes and my behavior. i always wish i could be as good looking as this person.. as hilarious as this person or as popular as this person. soon enough i'm trying to copy all their styles and personalities. where am i? why do i do this? who am i? and why am i writing this?

but yeah.. those are my thoughts for today. dont mind me.
