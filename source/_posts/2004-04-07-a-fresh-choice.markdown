with the advent of these things known as "college admissions letters" i realized something last night:

it's time to choose.

and i realize i've just shoved college to the back of my mind like something that deserves consideration after this and this and that, but eventually it's gonna be crunch time and all these important decisions have to be made.

i'm honestly not scared. i'm honestly not nervous. not yet, anyways.

and i realized something else yesterday: there's gonna be a lot of last times and goodbyes coming in the next couple of months. so many, that i'm not sure how i'm going to handle them.

i want to write more, but nothing's quite sorted out in my head.. not entirely, anyways.

oh yeah: if there's one thing on my to-do list for the remainder of the year, it's this: to be more transparent and to be more REAL. and honestly it's because i've been looking at my life and wondering how people were gonna see God working in me if i kept covering up my triumphs and my struggles. so i wanna be genuine. yeah, gangster, forealz.
