the exhilaration was thick in the air. the final climax had been reached, the end was near. and the graduating class pumped their fists with celebratory energy.

but in the dying light, after the staccato flashes of the cameras and after the murmuring hum of fawning relatives had died out, there was an emptiness.

"so how does it feel?" he asked.

"horrible, really." she replied.

there was a silence as they walked back to the school campus. what could he say? nothing.

they stopped, and he turned to face her.

"well enjoy the night okay?"

"you too" she mustered through saddened eyes. "i'll talk to you later okay?"

and the reality sunk in: would she really? after this night, after this summer, after this year, would she really?

no, that's not how it would happen. the realization made him shudder.

and he was left standing, watching as she walked through the gates in the glittering night, a night of no more.

_class of 03 you have only had respect from me.. i've grown up with and gotten to know so many of you guys.. i wish every one of you the brightest of futures. saying goodbye is tough but i know that you will go onto much better things. congratulations, and good luck. _
