**I. Striving is Futile**
I'm thankful; this week I realized
I'm not who I think I am and I
can't do what I thought I could so I
am less of a Super
Hero! than I thought.

**II. Give And Take: A Fair Trade.**
Broken down and brought back up.
Rinse and repeat. I can't
quite figure this out but it can't be normal.

**III. Modern Music Sucks**
Green-to-gold is a strange
colour transition (because it turns puke
in between) but on the sky
tonight it's worthy of
two thirty-five cent postcards.

**IV. A Life Worth Living**
He's doubled over in guilt because his
Grandmother has passed away and so
has his memory of her, within two weeks.
