Back from CCIC Youth Retreat as a counselor. Man, my cabin guys were fresh. Excited for y'all.

Me and Julia

An "aw" worthy pic of Julie. Or, at least, the back of her head.

I'm moving up to Berkeley next week! That means this last week I've gotta meet up with folks I haven't seen yet. Gah! So many. Where did that summer go?

At college fellowship we were discussing compassion and where it comes from. I find that I mix this up with "pity" very often. Where does one stop and the other start? I mean, I want to feel that pure emotion of... compassion but sometimes all I can muster is a kind of "oh-I'm-sorry-for-you" and a little bit of "look-at-how-good-i-am" that ends up being pretty selfish when I think about it.
