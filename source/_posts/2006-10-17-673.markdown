I'm having one heckuva time trying to get this CS160 code working.  
(Mutters incoherently)  
Swing/SWT gurus, please show me how. I will love you for it.

I realized today I have fulfilled Childhood Dream #4: When I grow up, I can eat tons of Lucky Charms and nobody will tell me it's bad for me.

There is no room to sit in this lab. TA Jerry enters the door with a bag of Jolly Ranchers and writes "Because coding sucks less w/ sugar" on the board. Hail, TA Jerry.  
  
11:45PM  
330 Soda smells desperate. The men (and women) are madly pressing away at their button-tray-like contraption. Send food. Quickly, Mom.  
  
12:36AM  
TA Jerry is looking more and more frazzled as laser printers run out of toner and as a clamorous group of red-eyed CS students press in around him like baby birds snapping away a worm held in their mother's beak. I'll refrain from terrible analogies in the future, thank you.

Eyes... bleary... contacts... scratchy. Yang (my partner) makes a big breakthrough regarding an event listener. I also think that these Anoto pens are nowhere near production quality; if a roomful of geeky CS majors muttering obcenities under their breath cannot get this application to work, nobody can. The list of printers in Soda that can support our project is quickly dwindling to two. Panic runs high. There is talk of mutiny.  
  
1:25AM  
Standards getting lower. A group has brought in sandwiches and sodas and are merrily chewing away a few workstations down from us. They are eyed hungrily by the rest of us. Fools, don't they know that coding is optimal on an empty stomach.  
  
1:46AM  
Partner has become delirious and is making bad jokes. TA Jerry is still running around at a million miles an hour. Room is still at 70% capacity. The thought of writing the readme doc in limerick rhyme seriously crosses my mind.  
  
2:06AM  
They are tapping out; they are dropping like flies. One by one. Heads on keyboards. Exeunt.  
  
2:39AM  
Lord, I don't want to die in here. Yang and I agree that we're pretty darn close. "Life is much more than getting a CS project right." We'll sleep on it.  
  
3:04AM  
"Okay guys... I'm going to start heading home now" TA Jerry tells us. Jer-ry, Jer-ry, Jer-ry! Yang tells me he's going to sleep over at Soda. I tell him I've never done that, and was hoping I'd never have to. Yang states matter-of-factly that that's exactly when boys become men. I tell him I'll wait a little longer, then I peace out of there.
