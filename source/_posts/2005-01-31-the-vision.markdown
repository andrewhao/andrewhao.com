"The vision is Jesus - obsessively, dangerously, undeniably Jesus.
The vision is an army of young people. You see bones? I see an army.
And they are FREE from materialism. They laugh at 9-5 little prisons.
They could eat caviar on Monday and crust on Tuesday. They wouldn't even notice.
They are mobile like the wind; they belong to the nations. They need no passport.
People write their addresses in pencil and wonder at their strange existence.
They are free yet they are slaves of the hurting and the dirty and the dying."

I've forgotten the vision, the goal, the dream. Kept my Jesus to myself, boxed up nicely, caged inside. Held Him back from doing the big things, the crazy things, the God things.

He longs to see people break out of the cycle, the traps and death snares of the ORDINARY. I can't live this way any more, keeping a bottled Jesus to myself.

I hope this doesn't sound arrogant. It's the reality of the life I desperately wanna live. I'm realizing my time this semester is running out, and I'm honestly pretty scared: that I'll have wasted this semester holed up in a dorm room. That people remember me just as that "nice guy". That I wasted my time agonizing over internships rather than listening to the guy down the hall. I'm scared that I'm gonna keep this stupid cycle of judging people for what they do rather than offer grace. I'm scared that I'm gonna hold onto this plaster "Christian" pride that is SO THIN, SO FALSE.

Humble me, break me until there is nothing left of me but You. This extraneous filler in my life leaves me gasping for breaths of You.

"What is the Vision? The vision is holiness that hurts the eyes.
It makes children laugh and adults angry. It gave up the game of minimum integrity long ago to reach for the stars. It scorns the good and strains for the best. It is dangerously pure.
Light flickers from every secret motive, every private conversation.
It loves people away from their suicide leaps, their Satan games.

"Breaking the rules. Shaking the mediocrity from its cozy little hide.
Laying down their rights and their precious little wrings, laughing at labels, fasting essentials.
The advertisers cannot mould them. Hollywood cannot hold them.
Peer pressure is powerless to shake their resolve at late night parties before the cockerel cries.
They are incredibly cool, dangerously attractive inside. On the outside? They hardly care.
They wear clothes like a costume to communicate and celebrate but never to hide.

"Would they surrender their image or popularity? They would lay down their very lives - swap seats with the man on death row - guilty as hell. An electric chair for a throne.
With blood and sweat and many tears, with sleepless nights and fruitless days,
They pray as if it all depends on God and live as if it all depends on them.
Their DNA chooses Jesus. He breathes out, they breathe in."
