jeremy lee, you rock. you dont know how much i appreciate the encouragement. hang in there bro.

ohhhhh Lord, what am I supposed to do with my life? i went to faculty advising today and was forced to look at my four-year EECS plan. OH MAN. hard times ahead.. is this really what i was meant to do? GOD i feel more lost than ever.

my floor went down to fenton's creamery today late at night because for the first time in forever, I had free time. nadia showed us around her old stomping grounds, we hung in a deserted sidewalk eating way too much ice cream for our own good. 'twas quite awesome.
