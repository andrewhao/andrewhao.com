It was in kindergarten that I discovered I could make people laugh. We were sitting in a circle, being read a story, hot and sweaty after a vigorous recess. A kid walked in late to class, I looked up right as he opened the door and told him, "Get outta here you big baloofa!" a line I had somehow remembered from the Disney _Robin Hood_ movie with the forest critters and translated into my own five-year-old language.

The class cracked up. I was king of the world, and to this day I don't even know what "baloofa" means.


**In the Wake of the Week**________________________________________

Been busy as heck these last couple of weeks. Stressful, you bet. Social life has completely flatlined. Reports on the floor are that I've died or perhaps moved to the third floor study lounge.  My roommate doesn't mind rubbing it in by chilling with his free time, computer games and humanities major. Curses!

But it's been good, really. Been pushed to depend on God so much more these past few weeks and I'm looking at some solid growth and accountability. It's almost frustrating cuz when I'm at my wit's end and totally ready to give up, THAT's when God shows up. And I'm like, dude, why couldn't I see this earlier? God's good y'all. Peace up A town.

I want to tell you all the 21092 cool things that have happened to me, just in these past few weeks but I don't know if a blog entry could suffice. Ask me about it, I'd love to tell you about it.

Blessin's
