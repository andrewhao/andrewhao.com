so i'd like to summarize everything that's happened this week:

1. **homecoming skits**
each class put on a skit (it really shouldnt be just a "skit".. more like.. "production". our theme was Hercules, and so we did this skit where Hercules (in high school) is rejected from his high school football team because he has uncontrollable passing power and because he has zero social skills. he is then seduced by Meg (and Hades) from the evil Cupertino Pioneers. fortunately, he realizes the deception and comes to his senses right in time for the homecoming football game and wins the game against the pioneers. yep.. there you have it. we really busted our butts that day.. plastering the school with all those decorations and the 100 foot backdrop and the pillars and arches.. this was a summer's worth of stuff all for one day. but anyways it was pretty cool seeing it all come together in the end (even if it didnt seem to be working earlier). major props to class officers who sacrificed a TON to make it happen. i observed what they did, the conflicts and problems they worked through and i was impressed. good job guys. we managed to pull off the production and show some awesome class unity as well.

the seniors (last year when they were juniors) really blew last year's seniors away. this really set me up for some high expectations for their class this year, and sure enough walking into the school on thursday really impressed me. i thought that the decorating was AWESOME (turntable platform, nice backdrop, hooks w/ names) and that the class really showed a lot of spirit (seniors.. duh). but when it came to their skit.. i dunno. it seemed to me like they tried to do too much in it, whether it be from the dances or to the traditional (eheh) class disses, the band playing or the skitwriting itself.. something seemed off. maybe if they had some more practice it'd come off great. but yeah.. i just thought that their skit was a little less interesting from their previous skits from years ago.

2. **lynbrook xc meet**
short summary: i came back to running, and i stunk. i'm gimpified for the rest of the season, and there's not much left of it. if i get left out of CCS.. i'm going to feel pretty bad. so yeah.. i'm still hurtin pretty bad in the shins.

3. **homecoming game**
so the homecoming game itself was as usual: vikings lost. actually it was quite exciting after the first quarter because the vikes actually edged AHEAD of cupertino high. that means, folks, in plain english: we were winning. but not for long.

ah, hallowed traditions. we love ya.

4. **homecoming ceremonies and results**
my fellow dawg Garrick Wong was on homecoming court.. very proud of that guy. homecoming results came in and to the dismay of the seniors, the pleasure of the juniors, and to the shock of generally everybody, it was announced that juniors won! i was so happy at first.. but then i saw a lot of seniors with tears in their eyes. i dunno.. seeing em cry made me realize how much effort they put into their skit. channing wong was talking to me and he just said that it was the system that changed on them. last year the juniors (now seniors) should have won, but tradition dictated that seniors win. but now the rules have somehow changed (?) and the seniors are very worked up over it. i've heard some pretty crazy things, and i would not be surprised if some seniors have some anger issues with juniors on monday. sigh..

it's really sad cuz every single class does the best that they can do. no matter the judges, each class tries its hardest. should seniors regulate on juniors for no reason? it's not because of us that we won - it's the judges! but all that blood and sweat and tears for homecoming.. wow juniors.. i'm impressed how we did it. i honestly didnt believe that it could have happened.

but then dont listen to me, i'm sleep deprived and dont know what i'm talking about.

5. **marching band goes to lodi and wins**
amazing.. we just keep getting better and better. it's so cool because i've never had a winning season in marching band and this year's band is the winningnest band that Lynbrook's ever had. honestly, doc and andy and mandac told us that it was probably one of the best shows that LHS has ever put on (despite a horrible field). we took home #1 trophies for drumline, auxilary, visual effect sweepstakes and FIELD GRAND SWEEPSTAKES BABY!!!! wahoooo... that's so nice (we were so pumped). i could get used to this but i won't. why? cuz napa's next week.

final performance, final crowd, final time out with friends. final talk with my section and final chance to do the best that we can. i'm totally looking forward to it (bust out some glowsticks). we dont really expect to do excellent because (i think) leigh high school and saratoga high are gonna be there too - two amazingly awesome bands in our area. good luck guys.

6. **i'm SO TIRED**
no surprise. get that chem packet done. now.
good night.
