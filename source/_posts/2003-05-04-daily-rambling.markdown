SATs yesterday were quite the interesting. i found myself sprawled on my bed, lights still on, and my head in between the pages of the _Princeton Review's Guide to Cracking the SATII Chemistry Exam _(woohoo!) yeah i wanted to study some more that night but i guess my body had other ideas.

the alarm clock flashed 7:30 at me. i yawned. bah.. maybe a shower. ooh.. maybe i should go grab directions to bellarmine so i can actually take the test.

well anyways the test was.. harder than i expected.. i guess it was pretty decent but i think the main thing that's gonna kill me is my haphazard guessing strategies.

but oh well, what can you do :roll:

my dad came back today all excited with a bunch of "free" stuff he got at OfficeMax.. you know those offers and items that end up being free after you fill out the rebate? so now what are we supposed to do with a fat honkin stack of 100 blank CD cases?

lately i've been feeling sort of burdened for my youth group at church.. i'm not too sure what it is. i mean, on the surface it's definitely going well.. activities are great and there's a lot of friendships being built.. people seem to be having a lot of fun. but i dunno.. it seems to me like we need to be going a lot deeper. i've visited a few other youth groups where its so.. God-filled. yeah i think that would be the word for it. total fellowship - the real, spiritually based ones that are forreals (pardon my language). youth that are unified together to seek God and not just gathered together to see friends or check out girls/guys or whatnot (hahaha not that those are bad or anything). and i guess i look at my own youth group and i ask myself - are we seeking God? where's his power? where's God's presence?

not that we're not growing at all - seriously we've made so much progress compared to a few years ago. i can spot out individuals who have so much potential in Christ and who really seek after his heart. but i guess what i have in me is a dream.. a dream to see my youth group transformed into something amazing. pastor owen at 5HOC was talking last night at their praise night that no matter how messed you think your youth group or christian club or church is.. God is gonna change that if you change yourself first. we gotta go do something about it ourselves first before that change can move onto others.

yeeeah.
