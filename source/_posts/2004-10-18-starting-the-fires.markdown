wave goodbye to my former self cuz i'm tired of living this lie. i've taken grace for granted and???somehow????along the way i've forgotten how much this stone heart used to burn.

oh, i miss You so
the feel of forever
oh, that taste i know
it hurts to remember
shane & shane - i miss you

old has gone, new has come.
