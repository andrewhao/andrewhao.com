teach me to love.

i've been fighting a frustration on my own, and i'm gonna be the first to admit it's taken over me more than a few times. i had no right to do that.

teach me to love.

it's easy to do on the outside, but it's harder to control on the inside. i don't want to fight it anymore, could You bring your peace? i'm sorry, I tried to fight it all with my abilities, with fake smiles and forced laughter. burn away the rust and the dross and make me genuine.

i'm going to look back on this entry a year down the line and have no idea what i was writing about. but today, i think this is enough.

-------------------------------------------------

on a separate note, richard ha, hsiang hsiao, helen ku and me are going into the MARCH MADNESS 3v3 bball tourney. yep, it's senior year and i've got nothing to lose, baby. you guys just handle the game. i'll try not to trip over my own sneakers. haha it'll be fun =) this tuesday i brought the ball out for the first time in a couple of months. wow.. it felt good again. well okay half of my shots rimmed out or never even met the hoop, but i'd forgotten how much i'd loved the game.

and on the same sports segue, the wilcox/SC relay meet got canceled today due to.. what? we're not too sure either. the weather was fine, but i guess the pits were wet, warranting a postponement. we were all a little bummed out i guess. was looking forward to the first time back on the track this year.. ahh spikes on fresh rubber, what could be better?

andrew, you've got seven chapters of bio to study tonight so shuddup.
