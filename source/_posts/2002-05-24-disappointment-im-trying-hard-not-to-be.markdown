oh my, it is. so SAT scores got mailed back today. haha.. it was like.. slow mo when i opened my envelope.. i was so afraid to glance at the gray columns (so i didnt). oh well.. i guess my score isnt the end of the world.. lots of room for improvment next year. i was kinda hoping for something in the 1500+ range, but hey with enough prep that should be no problem. i think.

but man, i feel so inadequate now.. dude.. standardized testing just isnt right.. it just aint right. it used to be that a 1200 was really good.. then the bar kept getting raised.

here at lynbrook high school, there is no bar. cuz you can't get over it anyways.

friday afternoons are so great.. especially when the weekend includes memorial day. ah.. i can do anything i want with the power to slack off =P gosh i feel good.

and then there's that lil thing in the back of my mind that's screaming at me to get studying.

anyways, at CIA tonight we did a movie night.. just a time to relax and fool around hehe. watched **october sky** (that movie where some teens decide they wanna build a rocket and one of them goes on to become a NASA engineer). yeah, that one. haha..

class of 2004 car wash is **SUNDAY** and **MONDAY** in the Bollinger Ave **Safeway** parking lot! come support us (or if you're a soph, come work!) 1PM - 5PM.. yeah it'll be great =P
