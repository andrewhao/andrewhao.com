its good to be back.. so the blog's sat around and collected dust for a bit but again.. good to be back =D

but wow.. even with a summer all planned out with nothing to do it's turning out to be crazy busy.. stuff to do, errands to run, people to meet with, things to practice etc. its really funny cuz we think we have so much time over summer when in reality it's so fleeting =( i have this huge to-do list sitting on my desk and everytime i look at it i get depressed 8O

college planning workshops at CHS for the next few weeks are going to be (and are pretty darn) scary.. i'm so lost in direction right now. i mean i take all those personality tests, work preference tests and they all seem to either contradict each other or give no real, clear-cut answers at all. like i'll be three personality types simultaneously. okay.. now what am i supposed to do with that??

i'm kind of jealous of those people who already have decided (or have a pretty darn good idea) of where they're going, what they wanna become. i'm just kind of clueless. i mean my parents are starting to put on the pressure.. my relatives joke around about me and all the while i'm sitting there in the middle, trying to ignore it all going.. _what the heck am i gonna do?_ here's what i know:   
**the life and times of Andrew Hao**:

1. i wanna do what i like doing. okay. simple enough right? i want to love my major.. i want to do what i love doing.

2. i wanna do something.. different. i hate going with the flow.. being "just another asian _______" (insert engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc)

3. i like: technology, creating new applications/designs, artistic/graphical design. i like being creative and thinking up new stuff. i like meeting people and working with them.

4. i don't like: being cooped up in a small room, confined to boring, repetitive tasks. i don't think a lawyer or a doctor are in my future anytime soon, either.

here's what i'm thinking: i'll hit up a college with a tech-related major and then see how i like it. chances are, i'll switch around. bioengineering, chemistry, who knows? that's not bad for someone who last week was drowning in these choices.

okay, simple enough right? now let's throw in the parental factor:

1. dad wants me to be a doctor.
2. mom wants me to make a decision, fast. and stick with it, it seems.

here's the question i want to ask my parents:
"will you support me in whatever major i choose?"
i'm slightly afraid of the answer.

but its good getting this stuff purged out of the mess in my brain. everything seems so much more manageable now. heck if you didnt understand a single bit of the muck up above, please ignore it. thanks anyways, you've helped =D

ah. till then i'm drinking in summer as much as my puny little world can take.
