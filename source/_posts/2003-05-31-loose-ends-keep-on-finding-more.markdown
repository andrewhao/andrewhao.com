i'm starting to feel the pressure.. yeah i suppose everything's starting to pile up. insanity.. have i signed myself up for too much?

had the 8th grade orientation for marching band.. haha the to-be-frosh are so small. whoo.. when was i that short? gee to think that i'm the senior next year.. when i came in school all the seniors were BIG SCARY HIDE-FROM-ME types of people.. and now heck.. hey we're harmless.

but yeah.. we emphasized the ups and downs of marching band.. i really hope a lot of em decide to stick it out and go along for the ride. fast learners, all of them :D
