ohhkay let's recap. things to be happy about.. hooray for:

1. **the end of school (for a summer at least)** wahoo junior year, what a rough year. from APs, SATs, to other big acronyms, tough classes to easy classes to bad days and good days.. it's been quite a ride. all i can say is: procrastination = the bane of every junior. don't. for the love of all things cheesy.

i'm glad i got to know people so much better this year.. i've made real connections with genuine people and that's honestly been such a blessing to me.

2. **a clean room** okay i finally cleaned my room today.. took all day cuz you know how it is.. you pick up old stuff and get all nostalgic.. then you realize you're just starting at a piece of broken rubber band and realize you're just procrastinating.. a lot.

3. **no summer school** my parents have decided that i've had enough summer school and so i should relax this summer. hey, i'm cool with that  8)  thanks mom and dad, you guys understand a poor kid =D but yeah.. this leaves me with lots of free time and a lot of things that i've been wanting to do, done.

4. **opportunities** to get things done, to tie up loose ends, to start forming good habits. gotta kick my butt into shape.. workouts and the such.. good sleep habits, practicing piano.. bleh the stuff i always wish i did but never had the discipline to do.
