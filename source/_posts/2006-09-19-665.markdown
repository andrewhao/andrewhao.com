And so it begins!  
  
Friends, I'm sick sick sick sick sick. Not miserably so, but just enough to make me wonder how I'm going to get through this week chock-full with enough projects and papers to fill the metaphorical sink.  
  
I told myself that this semester would be different. Health over academics. God (-seeking, -savoring) over ministry (funny how I see them as exclusive... hm). I'm trying to pull out of the fast lane. I'm in some sort of transition period, but it strangely doesn't feel as such.  
  
By grace alone that gives me another breath,  
-Andrew
