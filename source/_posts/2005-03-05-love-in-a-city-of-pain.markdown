I'm learning to love this place like my own. Smell it???it's in the street market on the corner as the neighborhood ebbs and gravitates toward it and beggars sit on the corner, cups out but they talk to each other and sit in and soak the sun and take deep breaths, living in the moment. See it???it's the beauty in the changing of seasons. Learn to love the rainy days where the rain clears the air and the wind blows the smog away. Ghetto rosebushes bloom and turn slums into gardens.

I'm discovering each person for who they are. The way they greet and interact with each other, they way they face (and deface) reality. It's in the way we awkwardly stare at each other when the conversation trails. By virtue of their character. By virtue of their humanity. It's in the way they fall in love and out of love so quickly, wearing different masks each day, becoming different people, changing colors and signs and pickup lines. It's in how they live fast lives and ignore caution signs because being young implies being indestructible. Day in and day out she wears her tattered heart on her sleeve. Coming out of the inner city, he has to hold down jobs to pay for school. I'm fascinated by each person's story and I need to sit down with each of them and hear them all.

It's in the way the masses swell in and out and around on campus. It's in the people who fight for a cause. You name it, they fight and scream and give their right kidneys for the cause.

Hear it from the cries of the needy, reaching out to you, their wheezing cries growing louder after hours. Intimidating you, scaring you, discomforting you. We turn cold shoulders and it doesn't seem right. It's in the way we cannot turn blind eyes to these things of reality.

I am a part of this, all of this???it's in the humdrum of Berkeley, a city of humanity and a city of pain.
