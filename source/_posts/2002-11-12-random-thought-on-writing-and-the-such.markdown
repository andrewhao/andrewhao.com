you know, i've been thinking lately on how i used to love to write. i was quite the avid reader back in those 3rd grade days and i remember thinking how fun it must have been being a writer. i even began an ambitious project in 5th grade where i was going to write a full book. it was going to be about this airplane (or something like that) that got hijacked or something.. kind of creepy now that i think about it now. well i never got beyond the first chapter but it was a start.

i dunno.. i've always hated and enjoyed writing at the same time. there's always that feeling of accomplishment when you're able to cram in so many layers of depth into so little words - and it makes sense to nobody but you. and it's always frustrating to just sit in front of the computer and have nothing come out. all the ideas you try are shot down, one by one like ducks (okay bad metaphor there).

i've always wondered how it feels to have a work published.. to have the world read what goes on in the private parts of your head or that feeling of accomplishment you must have knowing that you're worthy of being read. like Vertigo and Epic, i wonder how much better i would be writing if i had joined or something.

okay whatever.. that's my random thought of the day.
