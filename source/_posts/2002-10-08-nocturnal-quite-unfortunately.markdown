2:30AM and i'm still up dealing with the chem packet. boys and girls, this is where procrastination gets you. the packet itself wasnt long.. it was just the fact i was being stupid and wasted a ton of time. and cuz some of the questions would give you a "cerebral assassination" to quote mr. seike.

yes.. the legacy of mr flores lives on in his chem packets. (screams) but i guess it could be a lot worse. case in point: soo lee

gsgnine (2:32:12 AM): i'm doing the graphing now
jj cool s O o k (2:32:20 AM): GRAPHING???
jj cool s O o k (2:32:37 AM): wait we have to graph?

yes we do. and i think we're in the same boat.

horrible thing happened to me while i was napping across two dining room chairs and avoiding my chem hw: i woke up screaming with a humongous cramp in my left calf. AGH. to add to that, i've got a major case of shin splints accumulated from this year. i dont even know if i should be running @ crystal springs tomorrow..  :(

i really want to race but my parents tell me i need to protect my body.. which is kinda true. and i'm feeling really beat up too. and why am i writing this so early in the morning? back to work  8O  8O  8O
