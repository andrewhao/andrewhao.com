today's weather brought back memories.

a chilly spring day brought a 9-year old me and my 99 cent kite out to my backyard where the wind was blowing furiously. it was perfect weather - for the longest time i had wanted to see my precious kite (acquired through a birthday party doggy bag) in action, with dreams of it flying miles high in the sky tethered only by string and by my own two hands.

holding the plastic kite out with one hand, the reel in the other, i started on one end of the yard and ran against the howling wind. i tore across that grass, feeling that kite lift up into the wind...

only to witness it come crashing down to the ground. i turned around and saw it dragged across the ground like wounded bird.

the second time was no different. the frantic running, the feeling of elation accompanying the feeling of liftoff only to be letdown by a crash landing. the overcast skies threw a shadow over everything and threatened rain. and the wind rushed in my ears, mocking me.

yet there was nowhere else i wanted to be, there in my small plot of land where my dreams rose and fell at the whims of the wind.
