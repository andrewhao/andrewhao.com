In the midst of the craziness of I'm realizing that I need better boundaries. Do I really want to be that dad that doesn't know his kids because he's pulling late hours at the office?

At the same time, it's kind of fun staying late with coworkers, sharing in the pain! Ah, yes, it's every single EECS class I ever had, all over again. Fun, but only for the first couple of evenings.

I have to remember I'm human and limited. God's sovereign and the work is going to get done with or without me. And God forbid if I am ever controlled by work or stress or deadlines. It's just not worth it. Shake it off. Take a deep breath, Andrew. It's gonna be okay.
