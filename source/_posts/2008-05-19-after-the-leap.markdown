There is nothing ahead but firelight, sweet chamomile tea, four ounces of froth and eraser dust. Suddenly, we too are children; we too are poppyleaf flowers riding rogue gusts of unbridled wind. The solace you seek lies one octave above, above the cloud cover, above the sorrow and heavy matters of dirt, scandal and earth. Sing softly--we too will be waiting for you in the risotto glow.
