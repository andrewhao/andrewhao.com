**so i eat when i'm stumped. **confounding math problem, writer's-blocked research paper, girl problems (okay nix that one), all solved by munching on something.

so anyways i've been working on this website in the past two weeks and it's taking longer than i had expected. and sometimes i sit here stumped at how to do this, where to place that, how to phrase these and so whilst in deep thought, grab a bag of salty snacks and pour some soda and go at it. i swear. it works.

today was a particularly bad day. 12 hours in front of these computer monitors and still munching away. it wasn't a pretty sight. worst thing is that when i eat, i get thirsty and when i drink i get hungry. food addiction? call up the therapist.

i don't know why i don't just relax on projects like these. i am such a workaholic (it's the genes, it runs in my dad's blood). i set big goals for myself and then push myself to reach them: nauseous stomach, bloodshot eyes, numb posterior and all.

i would do something about it, but hang on -- the wheat thins are calling.
