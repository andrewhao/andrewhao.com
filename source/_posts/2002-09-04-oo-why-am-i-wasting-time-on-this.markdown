it's been a **long** day and i really need to start my hw. so here's some of the things that have been going through my mind today:

**breakfast at IHOP:** with priscilla, gabe and yip. the most expensive pancakes and eggs i've had in a while. but good.

**school:** dragged on forever. our short block wednesdays seem more like a full block day. zzzzzzzzzz. brown bag college seminar at lunch in the library - very informative, got me thinking.

**xc practice** twisted ankle from yesterday killed me. i'm favoring my right foot so i've lost about 25% of my speed. the meet tomo doesnt look so good. and my legs are freaking tired.

**piano practice** let me say this: you learn so much about your own character, self-confidence and self-worth while you play. and while you're shouted at. and made to feel like dirt. you also find that you're not thinking about the music and your mind wanders.

**marching band** frustrating practice today -people just couldnt get it together. ugh.. i think i lost it a few times.. feel bad about that. complicated issue came up involving kicking out some people and introducing new ones. and i feel really bad. i'll post on that later..

when i tried out to be SL i never asked for things this complicated. siiiiiigh..  :cry:

okay. enough time wasted here. i'm freaking tired and its hw time. devos.. must do them.

sigh...
