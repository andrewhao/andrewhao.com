i don't sleep, i just rest my eyes.
at least that's how it seems these days.

i've been having the CCLR core team come over these past two nights for some last-minute preparation before we head up on friday. i must say that after some prayer and just a time of encouragement, everything we had been growing white hair over for the past two weeks was wiped out and replaced by some incredible PEACE.

thanks God, You provide. it's crazy. You are almighty, ain't no devil gon' step up to THAT.

"if God is for us, who can be against us?"

i have to tell you my side view mirror story. no, not my vertigo piece, but how Satan tried to keep me from going up this weekend and how my side view mirror met its unfortunate end on monday morning. but i'll save that for later. remind me.

okay i have an incredibly busy night/day/night ahead of me, i feel loopily good.
