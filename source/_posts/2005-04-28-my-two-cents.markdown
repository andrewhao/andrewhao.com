Okay, all you agonizing seniors trying to decide where to go. Sit down now. Gramps is gonna tell y'all a story.

LA v. Berkeley (?) was why I was feeling a little anxious on the week coming up to May 1. Why LA? They told me there was better weather, a nice posh neighborhood, a larger selection of ladies, and incredible cafeteria food. I mostly considered the fact they had an art/design school and Berkeley didn't.

So why Berkeley then? They told me it was far enough but not too far from home (supply runs baby), a world-class university with top-notch departments across the board, and the fact that I had gotten into one of the most rigorous and prestigious engineering departments in the nation.

Here's how I decided: I was going to visit UCLA over spring break, but plans fell through. Thus on the final week of May 1 I was "what the heck" and submitted my acceptance to Cal. The End.

Anticlimactic? For sure. So this was my decision, and here was my rationale.

- I was (and still am) totally confused as to what I am to study and graduate with as a degree. I thought that if I dropped out of one department, I could go to another and still have it be world-class.

- I visited a few times and loved the urban city life. Visit all the shops and food on Telegraph and Shattuck Ave, there is so much to see and taste and it's so freakin cheap.

- I didn't want to be caught up in a "Cupertino bubble" -- that is, a rich, nice, (sub)urban neighborhood. Berkeley was real world.

- I love art&design; and seriously considered pursuing it, but I didn't know about studying it as a major. I figured I can do this as a hobby both in school and later on in life.

- I know tons of people here. I talked to them, they convinced me to come. I remember talking to Tony Xu on Cal Day and he was telling me all the ways he had grown.

COMING HERE and after spending a year, I still don't know much but here's what I do know:

1) Don't come here based on the academic merit of the school. If that's your only reason for coming, you'll be miserable.

2) You will find that Lynbrook has trained you well to fit into the academic environment. I say that if you came from Lynbrook, you are above 50% of people here academically.

3) That said, I also realize how much high school has ingrained that pure-academic focus on you guys. Please don't do that, take your college time to explore your interests, check out a couple of student groups, do something you normally wouldn't. I hate to see people waste their lives chasing grades, a degree, a career. There is so much more to life than that.

4) Tying into that, **you will be academically humbled**. That may be because your study habits are screwy (you will need to learn how to study efficiently), or even if you're plumb trying your best, you will not be able to get your customary A. And you know what, that's okay. My academic philosophy is: Do your best, then let it go. Doing your best DOES mean: knowing when to go out & have fun and when to stay in and hunker down, staying FAR AWAY from anime/computer games and learning where you study best (in your room/study lounge/library).

5) Connect with people -- especially if you're in the dorms, take advantage of meeting new people and experiencing the diversity you will probably never experience again. I say: room with somebody you don't know. It will teach you things about yourself you never knew (this can be a good thing or a bad thing).

6) Cal football kicks arse, real hard. Football games are plain freakin awesome, especially if they're televised on national TV. The student section is wild. Be a part of it, especially with your free tickets.

7) Know your boundaries. I know everybody wants to push them a little when they get here cuz it's their chance to be a new person. I say it's okay to test out your boundaries, but NEVER at the risk of your own body or another person's health. It's okay to say no; people respect you for that.

8) Get rooted spiritually. This was the major source of my growth this year. I have been so blessed by this.

9) You don't have to know your major, your goals, your career. I came in this year expecting to know 100% by the end of frosh year. It's still pretty hazy and up in the air. Pray about it, it'll get clearer with time and the more classes you take.

10) Buggin' with your parents, they want you one place and you want to go the other? Unless you're paying a majority for your college tuition, go with your parents' wishes.

11) Honestly, you will grow to love whichever place you go. Unless you get mugged there. So, don't stress too much about this and just don't get mugged. So simple.

Okay, I'm gonna say more but I've gotta jet to class. Leave a comment if you've got one.
