I took my first full day of rest yesterday. It felt right.  
  
I headed up to the hills above Lawrence Hall of Science with a guitar and a journal and kicked it with Jesus for a few hours.  
  
Then I took a sweet nap.  
  
Then I went out for a run: five Campanile repeats and a core workout in the gym.  
  
Then I ate dinner without a book in front of me.  
  
And slept early.  
  
Yesterday was right :D
