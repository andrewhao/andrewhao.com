i haven't had the hair cut since my student ID picture was taken in June. i'm joining small group leader jon akutagawa and a couple of other guys in a great experiment called "no-shave november" which really is a valiant facial hair contest to see who can be really grody, really nasty, really fast.

i miss good ol vertigo. all these freaking math and science classes are draining me of any creativity or inspiration i (couldawoulda) had. man, i miss reading a good book for the heck of it and being moved and inspired to write right after. i used to get frustrated because i always wanted to write like steinbeck but whatever came out just paled in comparison. i had to learn to find my own voice, cliche cliche cliche i know but profound. and now that i'm here my inner writer is dyinnnngg...

with the bed about two inches from my face it's so easy some nights to lean over and take.. a.. nap. which turns into a whole night.

(three boogers: one wet two flaky) it's only temporary as i've been meaning to finish that for awhile. maybe a very long while. there's also a design portfolio i was supposed to finish this summer but never got around to it. and a couple of websites i have been meaning to start but oh dear. that's the story of my life, a bunch of half finished things lying around and generally stinking up the place.

the super DC is a good way to die of coronary heart failure. mark it down, folks: next semester.

LORD. break me down, humble me. break my heart, burn my soul. there needs to be more of You and less of me. i've been growing stale and apart and just realizing how lonely it is. show me what it means to be a CHILD. not going to you out of guilt or obligation, but purely out of a joy found in the security of your presence and the FREEDOM you bring.
