I've been marinating in the idea of communities that display God's boundless grace. Brothers and sisters that care just as much about _who you are now_ than _who you need to be_.

In Christian circles, I hear many stories of _victory_, of _conquering sin_, of _success_. It's done with much bravado--_it's finished! Sallgood! _And when they are genuine proclamations, we celebrate together.

And sometimes, I wonder if we trumpet the successes so loudly that we silence the revelation of our brokenness.

I came up with a few reasons why I didn't want to show people I was broken:



	
  1. I would have to admit I suck.

	
  2. Admitting I suck would somehow prove that God sucks.

	
  3. Other people, once they saw me failing, would stop trying to be holy.


Let's say we had a Pastor Ted Haggard in our midst, the man whose [now-public](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Haggard) indiscretions took him down in a messy fireball of controversy and finger-pointing. Could Christian leaders have done better than to send him away to out-of-state Christian counseling (and months later deceptively declare him "cured")? Who's fooling who?

What if the Christian community, full of _faithhopelove_, picked him up and walked with him? What if they pulled him further in instead of shoving him out?

The Church has a concern with holiness (and that is good). Can that happen while embracing brokenness--_in the light (1 Jn 1:5-10)_--naked, ugly, & exposed?
