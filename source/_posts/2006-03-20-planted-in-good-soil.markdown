In contrast with the nebulous nature of my past posts, let me keep you updated on some real facts in my life:

1) **EECS is hard, **but I'm getting through it. Kind of liking it (operative phrase is 'Kind of').

2) **I got a haircut, three-and-a-half months overdue.** My hairstyle hasn't changed since high school. That is, it swings between messily cut (yes I still cut my own hair) and grossly overgrown. Personal hygiene is becoming a bigger necessity. Oh, and I'm shaving (more) regularly.

3) **I've started running again** and <strike>eating healthily</strike>. After two months of inactivity and junk food, my gut told me to get into shape.

4) **Prayer team has been surprisingly good. **.I love these guys and girls. I love the real, raw conversations. Seems like we're all wrestling with core issues of faith and trust and intimacy and growth, but it's so real. And God's meeting us.

5) **Apartment life is pretty good**. Charles Mike and I still barely see each other very much due to different schedules, but we make things work in our apartment. No, we haven't cooked very much this semester. I'm talking like.. we've cooked maybe two or three meals. Neither have we vacuumed. On the other hand, we have a very impressively stocked freezer.

6) **"How's soph group?"** I get asked once in awhile. Answer: much different from how I'd envisioned it last year at this point, but still _sogood_. We are going back through the Gospel at this point and looking at the roots of what we believe and breaking it down. Thanks God for realness between the bros (and sisters i'm sure as well). Yeah honestly? I was worried about the group early on in the year. But man, how much bigger and crazier and more powerful is our God?

7) **I think puberty's ended for me.** How do I know? I have this sexy silky Bublesque voice now. But only when I dream. Last month when I had the flu, I actually pulled off the Jr High Squeak.

8) **No girlfriend.** Not ready.

9) **"A friend to all is a friend to none."** Which sucks, but also reminds me I need to focus on certain relationships more than others.

10) **I'm riding a longboard now.** Sector 9 Cosmic One (some model between 2000 and 2003 I think). Yeah, the scooter broke, but I shed no tears.

11) **My sister got into UCSD as a Comm major! **I'm sofreakinhappy for her!  :)

12) **For the past **summer, winter, spring I've working on [FAQQLY](http://www.faqqly.com), this social networking startup. I wish I had time to explain it, but I'll have to let you sign up when we launch within the month. It's gonna be big. It probably won't put our friends Myspace or Facebook out of business, but it should give em a run for their money =)

13) **UC Berkeley pulled off another 48 hour prayer furnace **and it was so good to see brothers and sisters from different fellowships come together (more diversity this time around!). Yeah, some cool stuff happened in there, ask me.

14) **If anything, I'm missing home. **It's a good time to go home.

15) **I'm stressing less about school these days. **Not because it's gotten easier, but more so because I'm learning to let go of the tie between my self worth and my grades. And not that I'm slacking either, but more like I'm recognizing my limits and hoping that somehow God gets glorified (still trying to figure out how that works) in that work.

16) **Yesterday I fell off the board** and managed to sprain my ankle (and part of the achilles' tendon). Prayer team prayed for me and where before I could barely even put any weight on the foot, afterwards it was a noticeable difference... I could stand on two feet! I'm still hobbling around on crutches, but WOWOWOWOW our God is GOOD and cares about stupid things like falling off moving platforms and the people that ride such contraptions.
