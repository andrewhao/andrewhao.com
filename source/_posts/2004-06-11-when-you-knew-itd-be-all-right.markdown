**thank you so much.** you know what meant the most to me? at the end of grad night at the bonfire when we all had to say goodbye, and you (all of you) openly verbalized what you meant to each other.

and when the words weren't enough, there were the hugs, human touches that lingered longer than usual clinging onto each other staring scared at the future and the loneliness it holds..

and when that last bit of connection ended, some temporarily and some forever, there were the tears.

i'm going to continue an entry i wrote last year at grad:



* * *


_the exhilaration was thick in the air. the final climax had been reached, the end was near. and the graduating class pumped their fists with celebratory energy. but in the dying light, after the staccato flashes of the cameras and after the murmuring hum of fawning relatives had died out, there was an emptiness.

"so how does it feel?" he asked.

she looked at him with a grim smile. "horrible, really."

there was a silence as they walked back to the school campus. what could he say? nothing. they stopped, and he turned to face her.

"well enjoy the night okay?"

"you too" she mustered through saddened eyes. "i'll talk to you later okay?"

and he was left standing, watching as she walked through the gates in the glittering night, a night of no more._



* * *


"don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened." abuse of the cliche nonwithstanding, when you realize there is no more, don't be ashamed of the tears. they are sweet badges of friendships, memories, failures and achievements. you earned em, wear em proud.

it's over and i can't help but feel a little lightheaded at the prospect of it all. how do you summarize a life into a farewell? a pithy three sentences that is supposed to cram all your desire to see the only the best in their _lives_. i didn't get to say everything, but maybe i didn't have to. sometimes all i had to do was hold on, close my eyes and not let go.

but thank you. this past week has been one wild and confusing ride, but it has really confirmed to me that my time at Lynbrook had made an impact on people.. the answer to my question at the beginning of the year. it's been worth it.

to the class of 2004, look at that sunrise.
here's to tomorrows.
