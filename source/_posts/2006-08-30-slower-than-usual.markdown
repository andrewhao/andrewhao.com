This first week's been quite different. I have free time and I honestly don't know what to do with it.  
  
My apartment's rearranged now (you may have remembered it was in the 3-and-3 arrangement, Communist-style). We've rearranged so Mike gets a single and Charles and I share a double room. And once again, my bed is in the same room as my computer (far in the future, Andrew will likely take numerous napsï¿½all unintentionalï¿½while writing a paper of some sorts).  
  
I really do like my classes this semester (thus far). I really enjoy the smaller scope and greater depth that upper-divs offer (I'm waiting for lightning to strike me as I type this statement). I'm taking an operating systems course, a human-computer interaction (HCI) course, a sociological methods course and a mass communications theory survey course.  
  
But once again, it's weird (especially this first week). I don't have class until 11 or 12, nor any classes on Fridays and I have no homework to fill that space (oh, it will come soon). I'm sitting in the library trying to read ahead for all my courses and, well, beyond that I don't know what else I can do. I guess the workaholic in me dies hard, real hard.  
  
It's been cool though cuz I've really gotten to spend some quality time with the King lately. It's been a slow transformation starting from the beginning of this summer, but in short, so many things are so much more real. From relationships to scriptural understanding to prayerï¿½it's been so exciting. And so many issues that I've struggled with last yearï¿½from feeling I was being too legalistic or being too permissive, dealing with insecurities in calling out my brothers, my lack of courage in sharing the Gospel, my latent disappointment and cynicism with the churchï¿½have not been fully resolved, but instead what's been most comforting is the image of the Cross that even now is burning its way to the forefront of my mind. And the realization that I never fully grasped the height and width and crazy depths of love that a Father gave. And the more that is being revealed to me, the more I can trust.  
  
(Sorry, that came out kind of rushed and jumbled. I'm trying to process by writing.)  
  
In any case, life has been slower than usual, and it feels right.  
  
(Unrelated: Hey sneak heads, that Fresh Kicks store off the corner of Bowditch and Durant is having a clearance sale (but they're not advertising it, at least not now). All shoes are 40% to 70% off - that's pretty nuts. I got a pair of [Royal Elastics](http://www.royalelastics.com/) for about twenty dollars, ain't that sweet?)
