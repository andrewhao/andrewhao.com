after a fitting baccalaureate and an incredibly fun, a lil late and a pretty darn windy senior picnic, all that's left to do with my fellow LHS class of 2004 is.. graduate.

and i can't help but feel that the time is coming soon when i'm going to be overwhelmed with the realization of the finality of it all. it might come tomorrow, it might come august 30, but it's gonna come. all those connections i've made and developed over the span of four, five, six years are going to be (what's the word for it?) finished in a week or so. it's a slightly helpless feeling knowing that the end is so near and yet there are so many of my fellow classmates i wish i had another four years to get to know better.

on the plus side, going to UC Lynbrook means that i DO have an extra four years for some of you  ;)

i speak sentimentally: i'm gonna miss you all. i'll update after grad, let's see how it goes.
