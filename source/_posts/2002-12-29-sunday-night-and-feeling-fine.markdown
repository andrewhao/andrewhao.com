today ended up being quite the productive and satisfying day.. all of the college peeps are back today and it was cool seeing em again. victor li came to church today! glad you could finally come dude.. thomas gave a good message.. worship was cool (something about worship that really gets you back on track) and we went to in n out to chow afterwards.

met up with Andrew Yau formerly of MV (supposedly he's got lots of experience with t-shirt printing etc - depending on who you ask 8O ) and we discussed sweatshirt designs for Agape.. i'm pretty sure we're going to go with him. seemed to take a lot of time and interest in our design and at a good price too. i've gotta go back and run the design past Agape.

got home and decided i needed to start spanish video editing so i've been working on that for six plus hours now. it's looking pretty decent but i wasnt able to play piano today or get any hw done.. bleargh it's been so long since i've done those two.

getting back in the devo groove..
