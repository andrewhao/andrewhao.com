i went to daniel lui's church today to hear a special speaker talk. he's Lou Engle and he's the founder of The Call - a sort of a prayer/fasting event held nationwide. man.. what Lou talked about totally shook me up. daniel was telling me "a lot of people keep TALKING about how this is a revival generation - Lou's talking about DOING something about it." man.. he's talking about a literal revival coming through the USA. hundreds of thousands of people crowding city streets and even the youth starting something major at their schools. and you know what? it's happening already.

fasting and prayer.. that's how we're gonna get God back to work on our school campuses and churches. that's how God's gonna bring healing and change to our friends.. our families. we need that healing so bad. there's so much brokenness.. stress.. addictions and temptations and pressure at lynbrook high school. i dunno.. i'm starting to feel a burden for the people at this school and i know it's from God.

can God's power flood lynbrook high school? can he change the seemingly impossible? oh yeah. impossible? no way.

you know how yesterday i guessed that God wanted to tell me something today? i guess i figured out why. and i'm kinda excited.
