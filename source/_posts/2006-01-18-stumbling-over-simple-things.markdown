**I can't get out of this trap of believing I need to earn God's love, or anyone's love for that matter.**

Grace stuns me. It throws me for a loop. Nothing about it makes sense to me. That's what's beautiful and really really frustrating about it.

_When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts._ Acts 11:22

What does "evidence of the grace of God" look like? Methinks it looks a little bit like freedom. Your thoughts?
