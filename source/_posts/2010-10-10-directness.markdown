Being around white people (and one Kenneth Leung) is making me more direct. There. I said it.

And I really love it! One thing I've learned about myself is that I don't always know how to be genuine; that I can often say one thing but inside something else is going on. This often has to do with expressing negative emotions.

I admire people who can speak what's on their minds. Man, there's quite a freedom about that that I'd like to have in my communication.Â No, I'm not hating on being indirect (and Asian-Am, to some extent), but I just want to learn to say what's on my mind. Dude. It's weird. It's freeing. All of the following I've had real problems expressing:



	
  * "I don't like it when _(annoying thing happens)._"

	
  * "I have problems with _(person's name)_."

	
  * "No, I can't do that for you."

	
  * "I wish _(this person)_ would stop _(behavior_)."


And most importantly...

	
  * "She's hot."


This has the potential to blow open the realms of communicative possibilities. Er... I hope this doesn't get me in trouble.
