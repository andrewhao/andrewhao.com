my dad took me out to a really nice restaurant the other night for my 18th birthday, and we talked about things that really needed to be verbalized. things about growing up and taking responsibility, things about leaving for college, things about the future that needed to be spoken. so yeah, it was definitely good.

but in the process, it brought back wounds and memories of a time way too long ago. those scars still havent healed, ten years down the road. and i remember sitting at that table for two, shrimp on one fork and feeling the hurt once again.

my dad apologized. that's why i love him.
i tried my best to. forgiveness.. it's the toughest thing to do in a relationship, isn't it?

i had to let go of the pain, still fresh after ten years. _"it's allright, dad. i've forgiven you already."_

and strangely, it's a freeing feeling.
