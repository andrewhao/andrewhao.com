I'm feeling a mix of anticipation and excitement ("wow! a real marathon!" "wow! SF is cool!") with a bit of fear as well ("will I make it to the finish line without an exploding kneecap or total quad domination??") as race day approaches fast!

I'm excited, no doubt. Tony and I are going to run this race and we are going to finish strong.

Some pre-marathon thoughts:



	
  * I need to be hydrating constantly today and into tonight so my body has enough fluids to start the race.

	
  * I've been eating lots of carbs lately--wheat bread and pasta and noodles and such. I won't be overdoing the [carb-loading ](http://walking.about.com/od/marathontraining/f/carboloading.htm)tonight.

	
  * Note to self: no fibers today. Roughage = digestive tract activity = really bad on race day.

	
  * I'm visualizing the course and watching [course](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwnB4VTUSUo) [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg5wTTpkNp0&feature=related). Also [checking out the map](http://www.runsfm.com/events/full_marathon_map.pdf) and making mental notes.

	
  * When will I hit [The Wall](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_4_15/ai_54237567)? What are my strategies to get through it? I have no idea.

	
  * San Francisco is beautiful. I am stoked.


I just found out that my friend Alvin is the lead cyclist on my wave--how cool is that?!
