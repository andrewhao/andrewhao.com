hahaha man it feels so good to be back home.. i mean hey its great to go on vacation or wahtever.. but honestly nothing beats your own room.. or not being crowded in the same space with your family for 10 days (that's 240 hours, for anybody that cares)

i dont know if i really wanted to go in the first place, but yeah i suppose this was a pretty cool experience.. my dad took us out to eat a lot of expensive food (that i probably didnt appreciate as much as i coulda =P)

west coast weather is so great.. i mean in washington and new york it was sweltering.. like 90-100 degrees. i was melting.. dying.. suffering.. it was super bad. so you can imagine how i felt when i stepped out of the terminal =P

leaving again on urban plunge (inner city Oakland) missions trip from wednesday to sunday. hey.. can you guys pray for me on this? that i be shown new things.. that god tune me in to him and so that i can really "plunge" into this whole evangelism thing..

i'm seriously thinking of staying up late tonight to watch korea's game.. **if you're korean, please dont read the next line..**

i doubt korea has a chance

**okay** hahah.. well it'll be interesting to watch anyways. plus i have the free time to do it! wahoo.. this is so great. summer's just too awesome.. gotta savor all this before august.
