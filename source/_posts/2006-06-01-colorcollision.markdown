Few things clash more than watching Sigur Ros perform on "Late Night With Conan O'Brien". (Sigur Ros is an Icelandic rock band with dismembered falsetto Norwegian vocals, hauntingly ethereal guitars and steady keyboards). And when their piece ends, the whole studio is kind of quiet for one or two seconds. Dead quiet. Then people remember to clap.

This was going somewhere (deeper) but I'm really tired.

----------------------------------------------
I'd been wondering for the longest time why my left eye kept hurting with my contacts on (this had been going on for a few months) and I finally went to my optometrist to check it out. Turns out I've had a scratched cornea and the hard contact in my eye hadn't allowed it to heal. So now I'm only wearing one and only seeing foggy shapes through the other. Gives me kind of headaches sometimes, but boy, sight is such a gift.

It's summer. The curtains are drawn back, a rosebush sits outside my open window, the air's warm and I can sing <strike>without worry that the neighbors can hear me</strike>.

The darkness envelopes and embraces. I have four free hours at night, and I am overwhelmed. Simple things tend to do that--I pause a little as I walk out to my car and stare up at the heavens.

I think I'm on this people-withdrawal kind of stage. Like I'm all poop tired from Cal and talking to _everybody_ and my inner introvert needs some TLC. No, not my inner Emo Guy, who makes occasional appearances. But more contemplative times, more journaling, some prayer and meditation. I think I could stay this way for awhile.
