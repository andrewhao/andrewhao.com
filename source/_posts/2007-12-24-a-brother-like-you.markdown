###### [Lana Choi](http://www.flickr.com/photos/choil/) was at [Suitcase Clinic](http://www.flickr.com/photos/choil/sets/72157600425754607/) and snapped this photo of Mike. Psst, she's also an amazing [wedding photographer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/choil)!


Today is Mike's birthday. I last got a glimpse at his hospital records a month ago. If my memory serves me correctly, I spotted "12/23/1953" under the "DOB" field on the tattered Alta Bates release form. He'll be 54 today.

I'm thinking of getting Mike a bunch of 10-ride passes on AC Transit. That way, on the rainy days, he won't have to ride his bike everywhere and get soaking wet. I'm also thinking of getting him some simple winter-wear: gloves, a beanie and a scarf.

I'd like to invite you to bless Mike. If you'd like to help chip in for Mike's birthday present, click the "Chip In" link in the widget below--It'll send you over to a PayPal page (that's an electronic payment processor) so we can collect the funds online. A simple donation of a couple of bucks would be awe. some. If electronic isn't the way to go, feel free to find me when you next see me.



  


I called Mike today and left a message on his voice mail wishing him a happy birthday and telling him we were all saying a prayer for him (please do). He called me back and left a message. You can consider it a message for you as well.

"Thanks for calling, man. I'm up here in Berkeley trying to make some change. I'll make it through. Wish you a Merry Christmas. Love ya Drew, this is Mike."
