6/17/02

we drove over to boston today. it was a long trip.

boy, is that an understatement. 10 hours of pain. 10 hours of suffering. 10 hours of sitting in a butt-numbing position with my sisters making a whole lot more noise than necessary. you know what? the state of new york is a whole lot larger than you'd think, seen from the back window of a dodge grand caravan.

i'll spare you the gory details, but we made it to boston in one piece. our hotel is located about six blocks from Harvard and another six from MIT in the other direction. haha.. i bet a major concentration of US brainpower is located here. this place is actually really nice, very clean. our room overlooks the charles river, where you can see people kayaking or riding boats. across the river is the Harvard main campus, with reallly nice buildings and reallllly nice lawns (i think that's what i noticed the most). my dad wanted our family to walk over to Harvard Square, a metro area about a mile from our hotel.

however, walking was the last thing i wanted to do. i mean, suffering in that van really gave me a sore back. plus the fact that i really hate walking. i mean, you'd think that a distance runner like me would think walking would be totally easy.. yeah right. i'd rather run five miles than walk one. don't ask why, that's just how it is.

well, we walked nevertheless. ate at a middle eastern restaurant ("Algiers") where.. i guess they serve algerian-style meals. heh.. i stayed a bit more conservative (didnt feel adventurous and try out the falafel or whatever other cryptic meal items they had) and got a chicken kebab.. not too bad.

anyways it started raining when we walked out of the restaurant. there was quite a bit of thunder and lightning too, so my dad called up a cab (thank goodness) and we got back to the hotel in no time. i'm looking out my window right now, and the view's pretty awesome. you can see all of downtown Boston with all the buildings and streetlights lit. the river's right below us and you can see the little drops of rain hitting the water surface. the entire sky gets illuminated every time lightning strikes and all the tall buildings become shadows against the intense light. very nice...
