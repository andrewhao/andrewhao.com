i love how my calculator can handle infinity with ease. i simply push two buttons and _poof_, the infamous sideways eight, the loop-de-loop in all its glory appears on the screen, ready to be worked with and manipulated with.

if only it were that easy.

the calculator has no qualms about working to the seemingly unreachable depths of forever. it doesn't look at its task, declare it impossible (i can imagine it now: _"Operation Is Too Crazy, You Fool"_). no, it just chugs along and spits back a limit or an integral or whatever you want of it.

the concept of etermity, the mere concept of _forever_ has struck fear and trepidation in the hearts of the most gallant philosophers in the past few centuries. and here, my puny eBay-purchased TI-89 calculator is able to conquer such difficulties within a mere few seconds.

will wonders never cease. how amusing..
