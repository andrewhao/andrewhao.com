soooo its all over. my grades are in the hands of my teachers and i'm free for these few precious fleeting moments.

man, what a great feeling.

this school year will be notorious for the following:

1. **lack of sleep:** little wonder this is number one on my list. sleep? thats for wimps. i usually slept about 2AM (if i was lucky, by 12:30AM and if i was unlucky, 5:30AM). my alarm clock is intentionally set 20 minutes ahead. every morning i wake up super groggy thinking it's 7:00 but in reality it's only 6:40. doesnt matter, cuz i barely get my butt to school on time.

2. **grades actually MATTERING:** actually i didnt notice too much of a change from last year.. there's just too much pressure that you can't let your head up above the water for the nearest second before the sharks get to you. okay, bad analogy.

3. **chem panic:** yes yes this was very memorable.. in the worst way possible. i remember that on "chem nights" i'd open up AIM.. and get hit with 5 IM windows within 10 seconds asking chem this or chem that (!).. haha its pretty funny now that i look back on it.. cuz we were probably pulling our hair out for nothing.. but it was super stressful nonetheless.

4. **friendships:** hehe.. well.. with all this drama and stress i guess we bonded some more.. thanks for the good times guys =P

5. **running:** haha i remember the slogan "we run cuz walking's BORING". awesome times in XC and track.. lets ignore all the pain, suffering, blood sweat and tears (literally). haha.. i like everything about running except running itself. seriously.

6. **smart decisions:** i.e. quitting LSD = more free time (sorry guys).. sticking with Agape (awesome times =D) & NOT SIGNING UP FOR AP US HISTORY.

7. **stupid decisions:** i.e. wasting half my time chatting on AIM, being online etc. thinking i could handle all the activities i tried to shoulder. taking afternoon naps, only to sleep at 5AM. not studying for SAT2s till the last week right before & ending up getting screwed over on them. SIGNING UP FOR A KILLER SCHEDULE NEXT YEAR. goodbye cruel world..

8. **the driver's license:** wahooooooo it may have taken a while but it's mine! haha will i give you guys rides? maybe.. if you beg/grovel/pay cash i'll consider it! gonna assume the role of chauffeur next year.. not looking forward to it x.x

9. **marching band + china trip** yeah yeah yeah.. some of the best times in my life were spent with you guys.. haha i'll be seein you guys next year. remember to suck it up and keep up the (lack of) skills! gonna have awesome show next season.

10. **assuming responibilities: **well next year at least.. gonna do Core Group in Agape and Link Crew and MB clarinet section leader. wow.. i hope im able to get the respect of those i lead.. (snicker) (snort).. nah seriously.. gonna need prayers^2 next year guys.

thats all i can pull off my brain right now... remind me of anything memorable and i'll add it to the list. cool.

oo i also went to miller's 8th grade grad tonight for my sister (Annie)'s graduation.. wow there were a TON of 8th graders and they're all invading lynbrook next year. crazy. 500ish? who knows.. this is also the class that 15 would-be frosh flunked out of last year. eunice lee tells me that they're similar to our own class.. i hope so cuz you cant get much perfect than us =D

gonna go watch tv? no!! thats violating the sacred no-tv-on-school-nights rule! i'm a rebelll thats right.
