I used to dream and pray for big things but lately they've all been downsized into smaller things. Just bite-sized, just a little less ambitious, just for the everyday and mundane. You know, just in case I get let down, it won't hurt as much. God, what happened to childlike faith? Lately you've been the God of lunchtime and a Scantron test, when was the time when I believed you could move Mountains and bring Life?
