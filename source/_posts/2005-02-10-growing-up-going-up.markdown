I'm getting so many pressures from so many directions telling me to "GROW UP". Manage your money. Search for internships. Dress nicely. Don't slouch. And for heaven's sake, cut your hair.

Aw man, already? I thought I got an extension on this growing up business.

Totally unrelated, but check out the [Google Maps Beta](http://maps.google.com/). It's off the hook and amazingly good. I will never use another map service in my life.
