I realize that the things I love to learn and study about are enjoyable because I've had older people and teachers and peers express their confidence in me. Man, seriously, just one person made a big difference in each of those areas.

I'm leaning towards pursuing a double major these days (I think I'm gonna regret saying this already). EECS and Mass Communications, absolutely no field overlap. I feel that if I can do it, then I should go for it. Get a full spectrum of studies for my education. It's also gonna kick my butt because suddenly I've got seven+ more prereqs to fulfill. I don't know, haven't really planned this out yet. But it sounds cool.

This summer is looking to be busy! In a nutshell:

-IV Chapter Camp right after school gets out. Woohoo!
-Missions trip to Dominican Republic.
-Back home to start DA summer school.
-Helping out at my home church.
-Freelancing a couple of webdesign/design projects.
-Helping at August CCIC youth retreat

Man, it's gonna be mad. Fun, but mad.

So I'm rooming with Charles Chen and Mike Hamada next year. We are going to freakin rock the house, provided we find a place. Emphasis on if  8O

Flippin' sweet, that's my small group! Yea, I can't handle it either.
