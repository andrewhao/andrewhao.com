so this whole week i've been taking care of my aunt's house while they're away on vacation.. you know the usual house-checking stuff. make sure nobody broke in, water the plants, feed the fish, water the plants, feed more fish and water more plants.

and allright.. so i might not exactly have a green thumb. so the plants are wilting a little. its hot okay? and.. oh man.. that plant seems to be a little droopy.. that one's kinda shriveled and eesh.. is that one dead? arr better flood it with more water.

okay so you think that virtually killing the plants is bad enough, how about the fish?

i've been left with the task of feeding the fish and making sure they don't die (i can do the first but i can't exactly guarantee the second). so my aunt's house has two sets of fish: the lil goldfish in the tank and the big poppa fish (koi fish to be exact) in the outside pond. how hard can it be?

harder than it looks, apparently. those little (and not-so-little) dudes are hungry all the time. and i'm not sure if i'm ever giving them enough to eat cuz they gobble it up in 15 seconds, tops. so every single time i walk into that house my heart's pounding as i check the tank and the pond for any fishy friends belly-up that are now on their way to fish heaven where the tanks are clean and the Top-Fin Flakes(tm) are plentiful.

okay, so i'm cleaning the pond today, noting the fact that i havent fed these fish in two days (koi fish apparently don't need to be fed every day). ookay well looks like the filter's pretty clean, the algae's not too bad and... OH MY GOODNESS.

there in the side of the pond, next to the lily pads is a poor fatty koi fish, floating on its side, mouth open and all pale. if i were a girl, i'd say this: "GARHRHHRHRRHRHREEEEWWWWWW!!!!" then i'd run screaming away from that dead floating piece of meat.

being the manly man i am, i don't scream. okay, just a little bit. and i nearly jump out of my socks a few feet into the air. okay, killing plants is bad enough, but FISH?! aw no  what am i gonna tell my uncle? i can imagine it now.

me: "umm.. i'm really sorry but... (sob) I KILLED YOUR FISH!!"
uncle: (deep sigh, shakes head)
me: (runs)
(cue violins)

and how the heck am i going to get rid of the corpse?? so 3 garbage bags later, a panicked phone call back home and a really really long pole, the corpse (goodness this is sounding so morbid) is in the bag, in the garbage can in the back. i think a moment of silence would be appropriate. poor guy. i would've called him stinky. cuz - surprise surprise - did you know that dead fish smell like, well, fish?

i got home and whaddya know, we're having fish tonight.

my stomach churns. "no thanks" i tell my mom. she gives me a funny look. i think i'm going to be sick.

my dad thinks it's cuz the weather today was too hot so there wasnt enough oxygen in the water. or maybe the fish have a disease or something. all i know is that when i come back into that house tomorrow, i better not see any more stinkies floating around.

cuz i'll run.
