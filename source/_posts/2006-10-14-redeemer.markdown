I'm mentally & physically drained, but spiritually refreshed.  
  
Thanks y'all who ask me questions and help me process. I need it.  
  
Community can be very, very, very beautiful. I'm going to miss this specific one when I leave Cal (too early to think about this!) And to think I almost gave up on it - the cynicism is melting. I won't say it's completely gone but I know he's a Good Shepherd and the waters are deep.  
  
Dang. I won't be as ambiguous in the future. But much of it has been spending more time at the feet of my Father, and less of it building my own card-castles. Much of it has been chewing on the hard stuff and counting the costs of following but seeing how worth it it is.  
  
And finally, maybe it's just shedding that cynicism (thinly veiled as pride) that's haunted me for the past year or so. I can't exactly pinpoint why. But having that "heart of stone" replaced with a "heart of flesh" is very, very freeing.   
  
I feel either like a pardoned prisoner, a lovesick fool or something strangely in between.

One thing that makes me sad is losing touch with friends. It's a sad side-effect of time & life.
