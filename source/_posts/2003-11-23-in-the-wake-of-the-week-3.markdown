**exhibit A**: xc endoftheseason party
![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/xcawards.jpg)
lots of sweets here - ice cream, bananas, fudge, the red maraschino cherries, what more could you ask for? (seconds, maybe) i gorge. mmm.. i think i'm going to be sick. a fitting end to a season - what a crazy (fun) season. hank and steph say their goodbyes, recap the season and hand out the awards. band people need to leave a half hour early for...

**exhibit B**: band awards night

**exhibit C**: open mike at B&N;

save the animals.. please?

barnes and noble found itself under siege from legions of vertigo writers (okay, just six or so of us) during the open mike event that was to accompany the lynbrook fundraiser. jess uses the 'a' word in the children's section, all in the name of good poetry. a whole lot of fun, i didnt even get to read the college essay books i borrowed from a nearby section. we got a few people interested enough to stop by and listen, surprisingly enough. that changes everything you know? kind of like _R&G; Are Dead_ (sorry APEnglish stuff).. sometimes we want people to hear and listen and watch our work to confirm our worthiness.
break;

**exhibit D**: club day

3 gas stoves, 3 rice cookers, and 30 lbs of korean bbq pork. phew. it smelled delicious - but we didnt count on it drawing such a large crowd :) oh goodness.. it was pure madness but so much fun. thanks to all that helped out.. you guys are great. robert koo's mom gets mad mad props. and we hope you didnt get sick from salmonella or whatever from the pork. we tried to cook it well, we did!

**exhibit E**: ASB baseball.
![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/asbbaseball.jpg)
folks, the responsible elected officials of student government, purveyors of peace and all around supermen and women of lynbrook high have devised a weekly activity at school: seventh period baseball. yes, as audrey is demonstrating in the picture, all you need is a tennis ball and a rolled up roll of.. plastic sheets for instant fun! slug it, audrey.

**exhibit F**: take up the cross
![](http://www.g9labs.com/img/blog/tutc.jpg)
once again held this year at NCBC, i felt that it came off really well. i couldnt get too involved this year as a leader.. so i can't really testify how much work went into it but i know the core leaders sunk so much time and effort into the rally. i didn't find out till after that pastor eric is garrick wong's youth pastor (he recognized me from track meets).. really cool stuff. but ya.. i found a lot of joy in worshipping at the rally and just meeting and seeing old faces again (CCIC-SV.. ah i miss you guys). prayer time at the end was awesome.. really encouraged me.

we went to verde afterwards to spend money on overpriced tapioca drinks there in the ghettos, the ghettos of mountain view.

a few other things:
**grades**: God's teaching me a few things:
a) you aren't invincible
b) see?

so yeah.. it's tough getting broken down by things you took for granted once in awhile. it's a wake-up call.

**AIM fast**:
i'm going 10 days of AIM fasting. i got tired of having AIM eating up my time and not having enough time for God, so i dropped it. and now that AIM is no more (with some exceptions).. it's so **freeing**. and i have so much more time now. i'm excited.. my time with God as of late has been so _real_.. just spending it in silence with Him and being spoken to in the silence. it's crazy stuff.. let's see where God to go with this.

**hair:** OKAY I'M CUTTING IT. all people talk about is the hair.. what about me?! and its about time too. i'm amazed my mom hasnt kicked me out of the house yet. but on the plus side, it's keeping me warm in the chilly air. so who needs a beanie?

peace.
