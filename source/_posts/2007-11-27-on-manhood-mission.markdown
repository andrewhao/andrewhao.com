This post has big britches to fill if it's going to live up to its title. I'm going to do my best. I was about to start writing this entry when to my amazement (and slight horror), I discovered [Justin has already written it](http://www.xanga.com/mitsuboy/629240865/item.html?nextdate=last). Big ups to him.

I'm going to tie down three recent themes in my life as they relate to manhood and mission:


#### A desire to become a man


When I talk about "becoming a man," I don't necessarily mean the desire to kill animals with my bare hands. I'm referring to developing character qualities of leadership, integrity and Godliness. I'm talking about becoming a man worthy of trust, good to his word, and nurturing those in his care. I want to be a man known for physical and spiritual discipline. And most importantly, it's about getting huge [biceps] (kidding).

I'm understanding that my recent desire to [move forward in life](http://blog.g9labs.com/2007/11/19/growing-up-aint-hard-to-do/) is a tad more than just wanting to "grow up," it's the whole package deal of becoming a man. It's not just grabbing onto more responsibilities, it's the desire to fill the role I have as a leader, provider and nurturer. That gives me a good framework for thinking about the following two things:


#### Discipline and becoming a soldier


Paul, in Scripture, pulls no punches when he's talking to young Timothy, a man not much older than myself:


> Â Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. (2 Timothy 2:3)


That means sticking it out. That means giving myself completely to the service of the King. That means not wimping out when the times get tough or I don't get my way.

As Paul writes shortly prior:


> For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline. (2 Timothy 1:7)


The way to develop character and spiritual maturity is through disciplines (and let the Spirit do the transformation). It's very much like a training regimen, right?

A good soldier must go through training. It's going to suck. But the good soldier "makes [his] body [his] slave" in preparation for the suffering ahead. I don't know who made following Jesus sound easy or painless, but the cost is high. The body count is high. The good soldier trains anyways, because:


#### The mission: Fighting for joy


I hear this one clearly. As a soldier, you must [fight for joy](http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Articles/ByDate/1995/1539_How_Shall_We_Fight_for_Joy/). Your mission is to see Him for who he is. Everything's working against you--your loudest doubts, your selfish motives, your deepest fears, your darkest guilts, your parent's expectations, your glaring insecurities, the American milk of prosperity. Your mission is to pursue him hard... and to join fellow friends, soldiers, journeymen & women along the way.

Isn't it easy to fall back on your butt and just feel sorry for yourself? Isn't it easy to just take the easy pickings from life's spoils and call it your just reward? I think there's something bigger in the woodwork.

So get up, soldier, and let's go. The Reward, the prize, the treasure is great--the gift of the Father himself. In Him we find our full joy and fullest satisfaction.
