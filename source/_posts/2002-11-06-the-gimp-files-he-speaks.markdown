**helpless**.. that's the biggest thing i remember today. running at crystal springs for DAL finals really killed me in more ways than one. i guess it was all right.. i ended up running the JV boys race and finished a not-too-disrepectful 8th place.

but yeah. all i could remember was feeling so helpless at the 2 mile mark as people started passing me and i couldn't get the energy to keep myself from dying out. now if i were in shape or in any semblance of healthiness.. i'd just power my way through the hills and the pain. but i just got to the top and.. sorta decided that there was no way i could push on.

kevin sun was videotaping at the end.. and there is no way anybody wants to see how i finished. it's horrendous.. bad body form, gasping for breath and not being to walk through the finish chute - pretty embarrassing  :cry:

but all i can remember is feeling so helpless.. and feeling like crap afterwards haha. at least this is the last race of the season. varsity girls and our eugene berson head on to CCS next week. guys' varsity barely misses making it by a mere 18 pts.. MAN  :cry: i feel almost responsible for that.. stupid shins.. aughhh.

but i'm okay.. really.

i read other people's blogs and wonder why i have to keep rambling in mine. dang andrew.. you're wasting time here haha. i guess it gets my feelings sorted out. somedaay i'll read this again and LAUUUUUGH...

but then i guess you cant really open yourself up on a blog.. i just can't go that far (unless i'm totally out of it and just do it anyways). there's always a lot i'd like to say but i can't.

gonna tape up my shins tomorrow homemade-style - saran wrap and a LOT of masking tape. too bad i have no clue how to do it.

sigh.. too bad this had to happen to my season.. we could've done so much better but i guess God had other plans for me.

so that's enough for today, good night.
