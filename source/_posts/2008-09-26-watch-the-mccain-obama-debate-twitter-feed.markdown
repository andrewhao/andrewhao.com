For those of you who are watching the McCain-Obama debates tonight, you can check out Twitter's election feed at [http://election.twitter.com](http://election.twitter.com).

You'll basically be watching Twitterers react to the debates in real time--pretty amazing, if you ask me. It's like watching a national conversation unfurl right in front of your eyes. Try it out tonight!
