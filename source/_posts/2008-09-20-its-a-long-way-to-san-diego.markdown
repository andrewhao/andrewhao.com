I'm not a big fan of traffic. Especially not the Friday afternoon get-me-outta-LA kind of traffic.

Yesterday, I nearly rear-ended another car as it abruptly braked. I don't remember slamming on the brakes as hard as i did then, and my car gave everybody the show of making terrible skidding noises and leaving a trail of tire smoke, NASCAR style. Afterwards I cupped my head in my hands and let my heart slow down from a million miles an hour.

On a somewhat related note, I also woke up an hour earlier to start the commute from the Bay Area so I could drive slower and 1) avoid speed traps and 2) try to set a mileage record. I averaged probably a little under 65MPH on Highway 5--that's an excruciatingly slow pace, just ask everybody behind me--took about an hour longer to get there than I would have, and drove an incredible 31.8 MPG (up till LA traffic, of course). Not bad for an Accord rated to go 23 MPG highway (that's a 25% increase in fuel economy)!

It's been good times with the family. I'm here in SD to see Annie and Esther off to school (both are attending UCSD now) and have a long day at IKEA and with the tool set ahead of me.
