I caught a bit of the [Girl Talk](http://www.myspace.com/girltalkmusic) show on Lower Sproul today with Derek and Brian (quite accidentally--we heard some screaming synths and fuzz/noise and figured it was either a electrocuting boombox or an renegade DJ).

I've never seen so many hipsters in one place before. We were _so_ out of place.
