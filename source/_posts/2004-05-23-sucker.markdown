woke up from my afternoon nap to a fast-talking lady with a russian accent on the phone. before i knew it i was answering personal questions. at first i thought this was some sort of college survey, then the questions were asking "what was your social security number" and the sort. CRAP, should not have given that out. idiot idiot idiot idiot. anybody else receive calls from a supposed VISA program targeted at college students? i'm feeling like the greatest sucker in the world and kicking myself every 10 seconds for it. my mom's mad at me, my sister's mad at me, i'm mad at me. oh my.
