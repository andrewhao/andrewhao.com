Today was a big reminder of how good God is.  


  * Waking up slow (a la Jack Johnson's Banana Pancakes)... to the sound of roaring machinery in the big Underhill ditch.  

  * Up, but still waking upï¿½walking to the living room and sitting on the new couch (big ups to Charles for snagging it for us).
  * Wandering campus: praying, walking, journaling, taking photos, seeing old faces.
  * Thank you, Lisa for a good meal and good company.
  * I couldn't stop smiling at the stories being shared at Tim Lowe's goodbye party. You have to meet the man to appreciate this, but each story shared was a testament to the strength and faith and humility and sincerity and hilarity of this man and the God who raised him up. I seriously could not stop smiling, and all I could think was thankyouthankyouthankyou for friends like Tim. You could feel the love in the room, heck, you could scrape it off the walls and collect it in buckets.
  * Unexpectedly being prayed for. Kind of like mugging. The best kind.  

  * Meeting with accountability. Thank you God. I know You love me through Jeremy.
  * Late-night sugary surprises, a 20th birthday for Eric, hanging around the College apartments catching up with friends, the warm drone of conversation echoing in my head, comfort food tumbling in my stomach.
Mmm, yeah. Lazy Monday, baby.  
  
------------------------------EDIT  
Has anybody seen the new [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) [changes](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130#comments)? Do you like them or do you (as many, nay, most have reported) not? Two design/UI issues stand out from my brief observation:  


  1. Information overload: The new layout displays far too much information than the skinny layout was intended to carry. Facebook UI designers are going to have to up the width of the layout (and consider the myriad of design implications that come with it).  

  2. Stalkers, rejoice: The new mini-feeds feature displays all your user activityï¿½whether you want it to or not. Is there any way to keep the minifeed from displaying on your profile? A quick review of the privacy options shows there isn't. This is somewhat a violation of trust between a user and Facebook. My prediction? Overwhelming user feedback will cause the FB team to by default, disable the mini-feed module and allow users to turn it on at their discretion. Additional privacy options will be implemented to allow or disallow the broadcast of your various activities to your friends.
These are all design challenges that we at FAQQLY faced this summer and, trust me, I have great sympathy for FB's team undergoing headaches caused by the redesign (it is unfortunate that the few mistakes they have made overshadow the positive design changes they have implemented). It seems the development team skipped a few steps in the design cycleï¿½they tried to attack the problem from a different perspective than the end-users'ï¿½"let's make Facebook a place to stay abreast of your social relationships" vs. "I want to have control over my profile, here and now." Only they have about 5000x more users. And about that much more money. And maybe 10x more developers.  
  
Plaudits for a commendable job with functionality extension, now how about bringing us design with end users in mind?

Mike Arrington of TechCrunch [weighs in](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/05/new-facebook-redesign-more-than-just-aesthetics/) with a suprisingly positive review, giving props to FB's "attention metastream."  
Pete Cashmore of Mashable! [comments](http://mashable.com/2006/09/05/facebooks-facelift-mini-feeds-and-news-feeds/): "**These additions might seem fairly small, but they could have a major effect on how users interact with the site."**
