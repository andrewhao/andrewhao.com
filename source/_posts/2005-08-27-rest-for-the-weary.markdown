This week's been absolute craziness.
So I've joined the IV prayer team, which should really be called the IV team-of-people-who-don't-pra y-real-good-but-try-anyways. So we've been holding a couple of 24 hour prayer watches these past weeks, and it's definitely stretched me in so many ways. And it's totally teaching me about faith. Or my lack of it.

One of them, is holding a shift at 3AM in the morning. And you'd be praying in a semi-delirous sleep-deprived state of mind. And you feel like you could pray anything, like for crazy, unbelievable things.

Another one of them is holding a shift at 6PM in the afternoon. And praying in a semi-timid, fatiqued frame of mind. And you feel like you could pray anything, but you doubt whether they'd really happen (and if they didn't, you know you'd feel the letdown like a ton of bricks). Your left brain is bottlenecking your stream of consciousness, analyzing the logistics, filtering the loony ideas, the big dreams, saying "naw, that wouldn't ever happen."

I'm still learning about this prayer-faith business. It's hard, but things have been happenin'.

This week's also taught me the value of rest. Or, the sheer hell of on-the-ball workaholism that's plagued my freakin perfectionist mind for the last week (not to mention the last 3 years). And feeling like "if I don't keep it up, this is all gonna stop." Like I'm that kid in the fable who has to keep his finger in the dike otherwise the wall will explode and sweep away the town.

"Ministry is life-giving. It never takes it away."
-Javier Tarango (who I'm sure is paraphrasing some other wise dude)

Today's the first day I really stopped and rested. Like, 2 hours of doing nothing. And it was hard for me. Something has to change or I'm gonna work myself to death (my dad says I'll get cancer, as he likes to take things to the extreme).

Dang, I sound like some sad emo kid (sad emo kids, I mean no offense). Which is not quite true, but it sounds worse than it really is. Maybe it starts with letting go. The superman complex, it's gotta go.

(Here I switch to internal dialogue to help me flesh out my thoughts. Nay, I'm not crazy.)
Think your God requires you to do stuff, Andrew? He doesn't. But he offers rest for the weary. Think His arms can't hold your burdens? Try him. Let em go, yea, that's it. One at a time. Feel that? It's freedom.
(Here I reassure you I'm not crazy, but writing this gets my thoughts in order, like praying in slow-mo).
