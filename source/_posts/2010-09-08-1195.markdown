_Our God is like a lion._ Relentless in judgment, burning in his passion for his church. There is a wild grace about it now; that the complement to love and grace and mercy would be his judgment, sovereign, beautiful and _good_. I see it now. I want it. Justice in this world, our God will not deny. It's hidden but it's coming, it's here but at the same time, still arriving.
