lynbrook varsity guys pushed it to the brink in our final dual meet today. good stuff guys.. the fight for the league title came down to one point - too close. paly's got the title but second place aint too bad compared to the crazy progress we've made since three years back.. awesome job guys. our sprinter dudes dominated the entire time.. our distance guys busted it out too. congrats to **jason whitsett **on two crazy PRs (4:58 1600 and a 10:50ish 3200 yow) and big ups to **charles chen** for a massive 6-sec PR of a 2:13 800  8O  8O  8O its such a good feeling seeing your own teammates put so much effort into their work and watching it pay off in major records and PRs.

except me that is. gah this is depressing.

today's running was.. the worst i've run in 2 years. this whole season's been one long downhill and the shin splints havent made it much better. i've put in only my best effort.. my blood, sweat, and tears and what's to show for it? some pretty pathetic results, let me tell you.

i'm not gonna make excuses. sometimes that's just how it is. and the best i can tell myself is to just wait. just wait till next year. this season's over, and so it didnt turn out to my expectations. best i can do is **keep my head up and try again**. next season.

that's when it's gonna happen.
