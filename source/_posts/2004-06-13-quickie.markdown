today was spent doing housecleaning.. a lot of it and let me say that it's darn near impossible. my room is hopeless. i also tried to cut my hair by myself. one head, two hands, one electric razor, and one messy haircut. dang, that was bad. at least it's summer  8)

**updated online thingies:**
1. [www.lhsclass2004.com](http://www.lhsclass2004.com) now carries the senior prom video.. click the link to see how it happened!
2. [www.vertigomagazine.com](http://vertigomagazine.com) is now updated with **issue005**, as well as e-print issues (didn't get one when we were passing them out? then download one!) from this year's winter and spring issues.
3. this xanga is going through changes. well, that's what i planned

okay and finally, calSO is tomorrow, and i am totally clueless on which classes to take.. whoooboy haha.
