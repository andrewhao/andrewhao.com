items i thought were important to note this week:

fondly recalling the days when, boy, i was sure the jerk in elementary school. fat glasses, snotty attitude, third grade body. not to mention teaming up with fellow wonder kid tiankai liu -- i remember snickering over a manifesto we wrote to the elementary school administration -- forgot what it was though. i think it had to do with gender equality in the bathrooms. or rather, girls and toilets, something along those lines.

the unfortunate realization that my college essays were truly, truly bad. writing them the night before they were due didn't help either. i think these documents will be the types of things i won't ever show my grandkids or next of kin; they (the essays, that is) will burn and never see daylight again. if found, they should self destruct in ten seconds or so. wouldn't it be embarrasing for them to be found and read at my funeral ("dearly beloved, andrew sure deserved to go to stanford because he is a swell guy and really really deserves it. yup.") how embarassing, i'd turn in my grave.

bourne supremacy was actually a very decent movie, at least for the parts i wasn't feeling dizzy, woozy or nauseous due to excessive camera movement. i mean, gee, keep the camera STILL for a couple of seconds so i know what i'm looking at. and so i won't have to retch into the popcorn.

finally, i'm realizing that scheduling college classes is a pain in the neck. they say to never take classes with 1-hour gaps in between them, or to not have any early morning classes or late-night classes. i'm not listening to any of that. i give up, University of California, Berkeley. you and your darned impossible to schedule classes, i give up.
