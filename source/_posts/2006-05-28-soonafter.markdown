Catalina was so different but exactly what I needed. Good conversations, lots of confirmations, prayer and rawness with soph brothers, real encounters with God, a lot of rest and relaxation, new relationships, all that good stuff. And mainly I am struck by how much community enriches and supports the body, where we find the "fullness of Christ" despite the times we find it full of hypocrisy and doubletalk. And I am so encouraged by what I see.

I will admit: I'm scared. I'm likely leading the prayer team next year at a time when I feel like I know the least about it, or I am not gifted with so-and-so's gifts. And I'd like to tell myself that's why I'm going ahead and doing it. But in so many ways that's why we're all scared whereever we're placed next year, and we're gonna plunge ahead saying that God, you've gotta catch us when we take this leaaaaap...

One thing that's crucial is losing this perfectionistic attitude of mine; this idea that being busy 24/7 is normal and healthy and perfectly doable. Leaving behind the idol of productivity and filling it with better things; things of intimacy with God and relationships and rest.

**Conversations Found**
Sat around at the dining table with Mom and Dad tonight and just chatted. I love my parents. They are amazing role models and examples to me.

**Conversations Lost**
So in the process of reformatting my hard drive I lost my 4-year old archive of every single AIM conversation I ever had. Yes folks, that's a lot of social investment forever lost. Late night chats, guy talk, homework assignments, convos with crushes, and all around good times. The pack rat in me wants to cry. But something tells me this is something for the better. Quit looking behind you and start moving forward.

**Self-awareness is so important** but I must admit it's too hip and new school of a concept for me to admit I need more of it..
