I would love to experiment more with photography.

I really love people.

I want to learn more about entrepreneurship.

I'd love to be a graphic design/Web freelancer, up to and maybe including the burnout.

I get excited about typography.

I want to take even more classes than I planned to take before I graduate:



	
  * CS260 [UI]

	
  * IEOR190A [Entrepreneurship]

	
  * BA106 [Marketing]

	
  * BA105 [Org. Behavior]

	
  * English 143 [Creative Writing]


I'd love to have time to do some writing.

I wouldn't mind [doing something I love] at a startup. Or a Google. Or something in between.

I'd love to write a song and do some recording.

_What do you love to do? What would you do if you had the time and/or freedom to do it? _
