what a day.. oh man. my head's still spinning from calc ownage (that is, me being owned by a certain calculus test). how bad was it?

_we take a short break and present to you Part II of Really Bad Analogies:_
it was as bad as those days where the sun doesnt shine and you bang your head on the door on the way out to school and it rains and you get yelled at by your mom, your sister, your teachers and your pet hamster (at least that's what it seemed like) while you whimpered along, hoping nobody will notice you in your misery and the worst part is that nobody does. and the burritos were really bad that day too._

oh, and you failed a big calc test and there's nobody to blame but you.
