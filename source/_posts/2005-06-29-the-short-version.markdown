Man, I know I've been back for a week and I've just been so swamped it's hard to find time to write about the DR trip!

Man, what a grumpy guy.

Actually I'm lying. I think it's been a combination of my laziness and just not being able to express what happened with words that are good enough. So I kind of gave up after a while. Yeah, I know. Messed up.

Me, Justin, Mike, Merry and that's site leader Andre down there.

The closest I can get? The trip was GOOD. Good in that God showed me things I could never had expected. What do I mean?

Friends.

I was going to write this fat post detailing every single little thing we did. I don't think that would be very kind to you, so I saved the full details at the [link](http://www.g9labs.com/files/dr_thank.pdf) on the bottom.

The kids would hang with us for the whole day.

Well I certainly expected to get humbled. I expressed some fears to some friends that I would be completely useless over there due to my bodily weaksauce-ness and my crap Spanish. As a result of that, I went in expecting that "We'll just work in the fields, and maybe that'll be it. Maybe make a few friends, then leave." Funny thing is that God tends to blow your expectations out of the water with His reality.

Andrew Insane Hao, a Major Wuss, wimps out when faced with manual labor.

Funny thing was that while I was expecting to learn about humility (which, as you can see above, I certainly did), God was more interested in showing me His kingdom. What the heck do I mean by that? I mean that it was hard to see myself as a servant to the community when they were so busy serving me! Take Mary, a lady in the community, who would invite us over daily for coffee and didn't let us leave until we had our fill of food (whether we could stuff it in or not was a different matter). Or perhaps take a look at the kids, who boisterously worked alongside us, simply because they wanted to! It was much about seeing Jesus work in the small things.

Friends in yucca fields.

One thing God did was open our eyes to spiritual warfare in a very real way. Read my [letter](http://www.g9labs.com/files/dr_thank.pdf) to see what I mean. So crazy, prayer is so powerful. This also helped my unbelief I have sometimes with prayer - my defeatist, "this isn't going to do anything" -sort of attitude towards prayer. Sometimes my head totally overrides my heart when it comes to these things.

"Help my unbelief!" - helpless dad in Mark.
"Help my unbelief!" - messed-up me, 2005 AD.

We'd hang out and play with the kids on Fridays.

Oh yeah. And siestas. Wonderful, beautiful two-hour breaks in the afternoon where everything just shuts down, people take naps or just sit and talk and take it easy. FOLKS, THIS IS NOT DONE IN AMERICA. WHY? WE ARE TOO FREAKIN BUSY AND FRANTIC. Relates very much to how I get caught up with goals and activities and neglect to take a Sabbath, hm?

We went to Mary's house for siesta often. Mike's sleeping like a log.

I really struggled with having a _heart_ for the people in the community. Before the trip and all throughout, I was asking God, "Give me a heart for this nation and its people." It wasn't that easy. Oftentimes I would feel _pity_ for children who fought over bread crumbs or I would feel bad for broken families, but that feeling of _genuine love_ seemed to elude me.

Rambunctious young'uns, every last one of them.

I'll be super honest, I wanted to leave the country at the end of the first week. And it felt wrong (was it?). Something in me felt like I was capable of feeling so much more but I just wasn't giving it? What's the difference between pity and love, or maybe they can coexist? These are things that I'm still working out today.

Breaking through.

Well that's the gist of it! I want to thank you all for your prayers and support. You've all had a part in this, whether you realize it or not. Feel free to hit me up by IMing or calling or whatever you feel like to ask me for more stories or details. I'd be glad to let you know what's up with my life now and how I'm dealing with coming back home.
