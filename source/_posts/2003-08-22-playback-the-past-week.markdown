so this past week has basically consisted of a few simple things: band camp and retreat.

freshman band camp, that is. but frosh or not, they're making pretty good progress and i'm looking forward to see what they can do. goodness.. our field show opener is 23 sets long and it's gonna be **tough**.. but its also gonna rock. goodness i'm getting old.. i came home last week and i promptly fell asleep, dirt, sweat and all. and there was plenty of it.

after friday afternoon i did a mad run to deliver senior sendoff CDs (we're giving the seniors a big memories CD consisting of photos and videos of events and other things throughout their years here). in any case, the people who go to berkeley and USC got their CDs first because they leave first.. i don't know if it's hit me that they're.. they're _gone_.

i was talking to judy wang (berkeley) the other day.. and wow i realized how tough it is to start off college and how awesome it is at the same time. learning to get along with people.. being homesick, having to start all over.. meeting new people, it's all stuff that we 04ers face next year. and goodness.. it's so scary and yet so exciting at the same time.

i was thinking the other day after talking to gabe at retreat and realized that i might not want to program computers or code for a living.. honestly something like that really takes a lot out of you and my dad keeps telling me how the EE field moves so fast that it's hard to catch up. and i was trying to work out some PHP functions last night and realized.. man.. this sucks. i'm no hotshot at this. so i dunno.. maybe EE/CS isnt the right thing for me.

retreat.. wasn't what i expected, but in a good way. because in some aspects i wasnt sure what to expect following up on last year's experience. last year was just awesome, it was big, it was loud, it was emotional and everything you think a real retreat should be. this year it was focused on something totally different. our speaker (barry wong) talked about **God's call** in your life. same thing that i struggled with in mexico, what a coincidence  :!:  but yeah.. i'm still learning to put my trust in God.. cuz sometimes i mistakenly think that God's gonna screw up my life if i give it to Him. and in reality, i'm probably doing a good job screwing up my own life in my own hands. that's a big thing that hit me. worship was rockin'.. it's so freeing to be able to worship the Big Guy (caps) you were created for.. there's nowhere else i'd wanna be.

so that was awesome.. but when i came back i was immediately hit with a ton of burdens and responsibilities and commitments. and i don't know what but they really hit me hard.

i really started to learn to appreciate my mom this week.. i shared my problems with her and it was so cool to know i have her prayers and support.

please.. pray for unity within God's family. a unity of purpose, direction and attitude. pray that we know how to love like God did. cuz that's all i know we need.
