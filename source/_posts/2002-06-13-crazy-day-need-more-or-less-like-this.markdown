yeah.. today was probably as.. eventful as days get. in both good ways and bad ways.

so we went to school.. 30 minute classes and all that great stuff. have you ever seen flores in shorts? lol.. "he wears adidas! ooooo..." so after school a group of us headed over to round table and had a pretty cool time.

i got home and found my ti-89 had come in the mail.. finally =D so i spent the rest of the afternoon fooling around with it till about 5:45, when i needed to show up at lynbrook to play in the grad band.

the graduation went really smoothly and had really nice weather. the stands were packed and people were pretty pumped (well i thought so) dude.. i'm gonna miss all the seniors really bad (as cliche as it sounds).. haha i hope i'm the kinda person that gets missed by all the underclassmen lol.. yeah.. stuck around a bit, took a few photos with the seniors..

after the ceremony, that's when the problems started. see, my hands were kinda full helping the grad band pack up and move back to the band room. i kinda realized that when i got back to the band room i was missing my yearbook and my pencil pouch.

oh yeah, inside that pouch were my car keys. drat.

to make a long story short, i wasnt able to find them.. so without my keys i began my journey home. anyways i (eventually) made it home (about one and a quarter miles back to home) eventually, my mom gave me a ride back to school and i drove it all back.

sigh.. im gonna head to the office tomo to see if they've heard anything about it. hope hope hope hope so..
