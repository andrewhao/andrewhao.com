I'm proud of you guys, having watched you grow in passion, service, grace, and humility these past five or so years. I don't think it hit me until finally this weekend when I was talking and praying with each of you: the realization that you are moving into a newer, better, bigger, scarier, exciting thing. Y'all come a long way now (remember the good ol' days in me and Howard's small group?) My prayer is that you know in your hearts that you are sons. You are fully loved, fully accepted, fully approved. May you grow into the calling God has given you. Grace be with you men.  
  
Booyeah.
