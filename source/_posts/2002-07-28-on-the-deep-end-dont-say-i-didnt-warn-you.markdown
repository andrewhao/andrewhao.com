so i was looking through my oral comp stuff today..taking the trip down memory lane: old LD cases, my previous IE speeches, forty-so word files worth of junk, stacks of victory briefs..

and i must say: **wow that was a lotta work.**

most of you know that i've got a negative opinion of speech and debate (LSD) if you've heard any of my rants in the past year(s). it was too much for me. mrs northrop may have pushed us a bit too far and too hard. i always found myself "burned out".. ripping my hair out over some case or some research i had to do at some ungodly hour that no frosh kid should be alive at. and for the most part, that's my one standout negative experience with LSD.

maybe a little history is in order. my mom's friend had been telling her how speech and debate was good for "lifelong communication skills". i rolled my eyes. i remember that rainy march night.. my mom and i walking into that frosh orientation where we had to choose classes. i made up my mind that i wouldn't be signing my 8th grade self into anything i didnt like.

my mom insisted on speech.
i insisted on electronics.
my mom insisted on speech.
i insisted on electronics.
rinse, wash, repeat. my mom won.

and i remember being so mad.. so annoyed and so angry with her as we went home that night. speech and debate?! heck, who needs that kind of stuff? engineers dont talk! they just sit in little boxes and type in front of screens!

**update:** the engineer dream has gotten much fuzzier.

so i went into Oral Composition 1 with the attitude that i would hate it and i wouldnt allow myself to get too involved. after all, my pride was at stake. if i started to like it, my mom would (in effect) win.

but as the year progressed, it slowly dawned on me that LSD wasnt half bad as i'd made it out to be. a part of me really enjoyed performing speeches.. especially those that made people laugh. well maybe i never was able to get laughs. chuckles, maybe. but you get my point. the tournaments were really cool. i never expected that i could actually win debate rounds.. and i never knew that i'd do so (decently) well in IE competitions.

LSD probably changed my character too.. i slowly came out of my shell.. the career introvert making the transition. i had more confidence in myself and my own speaking ability. some of you guys commented on that in my yearbook this year.

no.. i dont deny that i nearly died that year. no, i dont deny that LSD is full of pressure and competition. and yes, i realize that most ex/current LSDers are bitter in some way or another. and no, i dont believe i could ever go back.

but i'd just like to say this:
i was wrong.
