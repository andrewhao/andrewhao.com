got back from church retreat last night.. and i dont know if words can describe how incredibly awesome it was. josh, our speaker, was probably one of the most fluid and natural speakers i've heard.. but more than that was how clearly and convictedly he spoke about God. it was totally awesome.

i dont know about you.. but God was definitely moving these few days. i saw so many people who've been away from God for so long totally reach back for him again.. on their knees, totally crying out for mercy and healing again.

worship was totally packed with energy and enthusiasm. man.. we were rockin' that place for God. when you're on a retreat with nothing to worry about or fret over.. you can focus so much more on your worship and that makes ALL the difference. honestly.. i think our entire YG got a whole new infusion of enthusiasm for worship.

but here's the hard part: what happens when you come home from that retreat and start your school year? what happens when you start failing tests? lose friends? fight with your parents?

how are you gonna be then?

and i hope and pray that i can take this new enthusiasm and energy i got for God and maintain it throughout this school year. gotta keep up this passion.. this fire i got for Him. cuz without it.. i got nothing.

and trust me, i've been there so many times already.

what will people do when they find that it's true?
