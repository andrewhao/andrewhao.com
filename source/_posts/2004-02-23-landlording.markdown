this is to serve as an eviction notice to any traces left of my ego or my pride. it's been inflating myself with false bravado over my atheletic, design, musical abilities. you've taken root for too long, it's time to clean house. yup.

on a more tangential note, have you ever driven down a road and realize that you're tired, and that what the heck, you'll pull over and take a good 2-hour nap? then you find a fast food place and park in an inconspicuous spot, recline the seats (locking the doors) and spend a good old 120 minutes in la la land. then you wake up and realize that you've done a stupid thing, that you could've spent that two hours doing something more productive, that you were plum lucky that nobody managed to cream pie or rear end or draw strange diagrams on your car. then you drive back home still feeling a little mad at yourself, but then realizing that those 120 minutes, 7200 seconds were the best things you did that day.

or maybe it's just me.
