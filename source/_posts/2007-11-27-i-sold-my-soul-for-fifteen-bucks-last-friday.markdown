O, America!

I was going to boycott Black Friday as a statement against American materialism. Really, I pinky-swear. Plus, I didn't want to stiff-arm any more grandmas in the electronics aisle.

(Ooh, 2 gigabytes of memory for 15 bucks!)

My will was broken. I got weak-kneed and kind of giggly like a little schoolgirl while on my way to Fry's. _Cha-ching!_

O, America!
