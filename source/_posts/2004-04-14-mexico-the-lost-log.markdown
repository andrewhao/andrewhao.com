_monday:_
almost forgot: last night a few of the teams gathered in the ocean room and just worshipped, one guitar and forty people. it was powerful.

opened up to ephesians this morning and read about Eutychus who fell asleep while Paul was speaking and fell 3 stories to his death. Paul went down and somehow brought that dead man back to life.

yesterday the chicago team saw a girl fall off a bridge into a ditch during their open air outreach. they prayed over her while waiting for the ambulance to come and in a couple of minutes the unconscious and barely-breathing girl came back to life. wow.. that proves the power of prayer in faith and its something i've seen in so much abundance in my mere week here. at the same time it proves that Satan doesn't want our teams here and he's willing to do anything to stop us.

even though we're just building houses today, God i wanna see miracles happen in Your name.

------------------

Well we didn't get too far on the house as far as finishing it was concerned.. but i guess that was all right cuz we got so much of it done. gosh though.... i ended up poop tired and watching MVCCC's (Mtn View Chinese Christian Church.. they came down the same week as we did) finished house right next to ours was a bit of a discouragment for us hahaha..

look familiar? that's julia kwan who went to CCLR. real thugs build faster.

how did they get done so fast? peter fong says that our builders this year weren't as organized. but yeah. the family whom we're building for is pretty cool. I saw the father (his name is Refugio) playing with his daughter and there was just so much love and happiness between the two. It's totally true how you don't need material belongings to be happy. here i was in the scorching mexican heat in the dirty and dusty hills of tijuana and this man could not stop kissing and hugging his daughter..

quite heartwarming if you ask me :)

we left directly for some tacos afterwards at a local taco shop. WOW. 2 words:

good food
gastrointestinal stoppage

but i'll take the diarrhea in exchange for some of those incredible tacos. they do em right in mexico.

free time for 2 hours afterwards and had a good time  talking and getting to know Anqi (harvard bound) a little better. he's a pretty chill guy and he's got a good heart. we talked about our feelings over this trip, college advice, good stuff like that. it's sunset now over tijuana and you can feel the ocean chill come over the beaches. we're sitting here at the milkshake shop just staring out at the street in shorts and sandals. relaxation <3

_tuesday_
i was reading through isaiah today and i read about God's wrath for Judah after He had done all he could for it and yet it still rebelled.

mexico is much the same, esp in Tijuana where the sin and corruption is so rampant. i wonder if it's a  very visible consequence of sin? God have mercy upon the innocent and the suffering. have mercy on the people. teach them how to walk in your path and break free from these bondages.

today was the day we completed the house.. finally! we had been feeling pretty frustrated the days before because we figured we could have finished it by now, but it's a good feeling to have that house nailed together, painted, and roofed :) i was on the roof (wooden planks and tar sheets) and there's a great feeling, just lying down and staring up into that infinitely blue sky. you look out over the dusty hills and there's just.. houses and some sparse shrubbery here and there and then the rest is just.. dust. some house down there is blasting a spanish talk show, and you can hear the dogs barking at each other across the hills.

there's something incredibly beautiful about this.

so we finished about 11AM and we split up into teams to take the word that we were gonna hold a fiesta.. kind of a joint housewarming party with MVCCC's house and also so we could hold an outdoor outreach. so me, thomas, jeff, junny and sam start walking down the dirt road and knocking on random doors. hahhaha this is so funny because we are all short Asian folk who took and probably failed Spanish at some point in our academic lives. so we're trying to invite them in super broken spanish and i'm not sure if they're smiling because they're too nice or they're laughing at our attempts at spanish.

met a lot of nice kids along the way, had a dog or two following us around. i remember this one house, once you got close to it you could smell feces and urine. and there was this small girl in a tattered dress playing with her dogs, and when we approached her she ran off without saying a word.

in any case we did manage to spread the word across the hills and people did come (free food never hurt). it was pretty crazy.. burgers and dogs and soda and lots of other good food. we did our skits and presentations and they seemed to go over pretty well with the kids.. even some of the adults.

and afterwards we did the pinata thing. it was incredible. those kids run like crazy for the candy, we had to restrain a few overactive ones =)

and the kids, i met this kid named luis who was CRAZY at soccer. blew me away.

what was really cool for me was to have thomas come up to me and tell me that one of the women whose house we came to had accepted Christ that day. i was so happy i could dance.. not because I, Andrew Hao, Super Christian, had done a good deed and not because that meant that I had "saved" someone, but because that meant her life was on an eternal direction now.. and i was just surprised at the joy i felt.

we went to Rosalito (its a shopping neighborhood in TJ) that afternoon still dusty and sticky and had a good time with Anqi just trolling the stands and watching him try to bargain for the heck of it. that kid is pretty good, but i think the vendors are still better. i was pretty intimidated and couldn't bring myself to bargain for anything haha =)


we closed off that night with awesome worship and a time of sharing. i feel that all the teams that came down with us have bonded incredibly.. we've gotten to know each other so well if only for 10 days. we had a time of sharing at the end and it was pretty cool to hear the testimonies of all that God's done this week.

_wednesday_
said our goodbyes in the morning and headed back to the LA base. i'm pooped.

these guys.. hahaha no shame

from LA on to applebee's at gilroy.

incredible. if i had a chance to do this again, i would. God opened my eyes this week to his amazing power and the fact that yes, he's still working in this world. there was an incredible sensitivity to the spirit during this week and it's really touched me. and all that bonding with the guys, you're all awesome and i hope to keep in touch with yall. i'm done for now, more later

----------------------------
nine months later, i can still remember all these things in exact clarity. i think the biggest thing that i took back from me is to have a burden for people who haven't had the opportunity to experience God's love. i know it might sound pompous and egotistical, but i honestly do believe that i need to have a genuine concern and love for the people i know and to share with them the hope that i have.

okay and i know that NOBODY's read the entire thing, but that's quite allright. did you want photos? i know you want photos. click [here](http://www.clubphoto.com/_cgi-bin/app.pl/albums/large_image_view?id=2142933&link_code=sa01_17) or [here](http://www.clubphoto.com/_cgi-bin/app.pl/albums/large_image_view?id=2219241&link_code=sa01_17) to check them out.
