a few things learned behind the wheel this week:

1. pay attention
2. pay attention
3. **pay attention, darnit!**

so yesterday i had a NASCAR moment when i was totally lost on Central Expressway, cut across two lanes to an exit i didn't see till too late then realizing the exit was 25 feet long and involved an immediate turn to the right. i ended up going about 50MPH around a corner with a "15MPH" sign posted right on it.

it was like a video game, only in video games your heart doesnt pump as fast. so i did a little bit of drifting (yeah, take that) and with the screeching tires and smoke and all that crazy stuff. and as i was sliding i was surprised my life didn't flash past my eyes. but right afterwards (and for about fifteen minutes after that) i was counting my blessings while my heart was going about a million beats per minute.

pant pant pant sweat sweat sweat phew. thanks God.

then today traffic was backed up about a mile long down 280 south. why? not because it was a five-car accident or a watermelon spill across three lanes, but it was because of rubberneckers ogling at a fire off the side of the freeway.

To look about or survey with unsophisticated wonderment or curiosity.

traffic backed up forever -- because people slow down a little bit each time to stare. and it adds up. well no news on the fire, but just thought that was an interesting tidbit to share.

summer's gonna be busy! i'm gonna take a massive break from the internet unless i hafta. reach me on my cell phone 621-1907.
