For those of you who don't know, I'm going to the Dominican Republic on a missions trip with my fellowship, Intervarsity. It's a quick two-week trip, where we will be working with local village ministries providing social services, sports programs, construction work and agricultural work.

To be honest, I don't know what to expect, other than the fact that I've got to be there in a little under 24 hours. No, I'm not going there to save the world or convert an entire village. No, this trip is not about what can be accomplished through my incredible talent and intellect and language proficiency.

In fact, what's scary about this trip is that it needs none of my qualifications whatsoever. None of my supposed skills or intellect really matters. I, Andrew Insane Hao, am reduced to a blubbering waste-of-air in a foreign land such as the DR. And I think that's going to be a good thing, a learning-sort-of thing.

I would appreciate if you could keep me in prayer. Just about the only thing that matters is the condition of my heart as I leave for another country. I am constantly reminded of my need to be humble, obedient and teachable (HOT, if you will -- take that Andy Yang). Again, this trip is not about convincing others to change their lives, but it is so much more about me and how God will change it and shape it and mold it and burden it as my eyes are opened to new experiences and a different perspective.

I believe that God's heart burns strongly for the poor and the marginalized, and thus I know it hurts for the Dominican people. For the next two-plus weeks, I am going to experience life from that point of view. It's going to be hard, it's going to be uncomfortable and it's going to undoubtedly be really sweaty.

My fellow group members also need you to pray for our safety, our health and our team unity. I know I'm not being very coherent right now, but I'm pretty zombied-out this early in the morning.

in Him,
Andrew
