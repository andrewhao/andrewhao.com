i told myself last year that my senior year would be a joke, would be a breeze, would be like breathing air or like getting fat in a lard-eating contest (not that i've actually participated in one).

but it turns out that they all ended up being delusions and wild fantasies. free time? forget it. less work? ludicrous. forget six periods, bring on short-answer college essays.

yep, i'm slightly drowning. slightly. and at the same time i'm having a blast. it's just that maybe i'd have a little more if i could only breathe.

aw heck i'm gonna quit whining. two more weeks, i'm gonna do my best, work my hardest, and we'll see where that goes.

**food for thought:**
i'm realizing lately that i've grown up so priviliged family-wise.. that to have grown up knowing love in a family is something that's affected me more than i can ever appreciate.
