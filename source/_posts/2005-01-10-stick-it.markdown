Did some massive driving today. Head hurts. Up to Sebastopol/Petaluma to buy a junky guitar off a seller on Craigslist, then to Berkeley where I helped Anson move his stuff out. Factor in the rain, nighttime driving, traffic, and I have a lead foot in several more ways than I know how to describe. That makes one broken New Year's resolution: No Whining.

I'm getting a third roommate, because the previous two couldn't stand me. Sort of. Mike moved down the hall after a month because our sleeping schedules were way off, and we were still cool. Anson's moving out cuz he can't afford the tuition hike that comes with out-of-state residency. Can you sing "Ouch" to the tune of "Thirty Grand"? Man, I'm gonna miss that guy, even if he did stay up till 4AM every night talking on the phone and watching movies and generally having more fun than  I was having.

I'll be staying here for the night and then back home tomorrow for a bit, then off again to go boarding (!!! first time) whence you shall never see me hereafter, due to sustained injuries.
