It came down to [E*Trade](http://www.etrade.com) and [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/). They had 20 seconds to make a good impression on me.  
  
I chose E*Trade. Their website is prettier.  
  
Aside: Does anybody get a little intimidated at investing? I'm not referring to the entire win-lose paradigm of the market, but to the weight of social responsibility. Oh, capitalism!  
  
Edit: I'm not turning into a day-trader, I just wanted to open an index fund account.
