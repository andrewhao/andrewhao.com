I've got my bags packed and waiting in an airport in Kansas City en route to [Urbana](http://urbana09.org).

I was thinking today about how much I'm seeking a calling (or a life direction, you could say). Life in the working world has its way of sucking you onto its treadmill, where it's easy to simply wake up one day, and a year has passed, and you're still sporting the same haircut.

But I was thinking today that really, this is less about direction than it is about identity. I'm known less by my professional aspirations, my friendships, the person I was in college, my performance as a worker in the marketplace than I am simply God's son.

I need some sort of kick start, something to make that realization hit home.
