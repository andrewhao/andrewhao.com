i've been feeling very weary lately.. if the past couple of entries haven't told you anything  :)  please pray for me.

do people change when they head off to college? seems like people fit into two ends of the spectrum.. they either come out entirely different (in mostly good ways) or they stay the same (in mostly good ways too). i aim to change for the better when i head off this summer. i'm gonna try to acquire an austrian accent and tell people my hair is actually a toupee.

i'm in need of role models. if this keeps going on i'm going to lose my way. fast.

ahh i sound so depressing. maybe cuz i'm a writer, and i can teen angst anything in record time. it's actually not that bad, i think the key to overcoming failures in life is the ability to laugh at yourself. just don't laugh too hard.
