well that was interesting...
another all-nighter last night (if thursday's english AP research nightmare wasn't bad enough  8O ) with an APCS quagmire that didn't come together till the last minute. thanks benjy for 923423 more hours of work than jameson or i ever did.. presentation didn't turn out as bad as i thought despite the fact i came to school a little zoned out (had trouble staying standing) and i havent showered in two days (now you know what that smell was).

ohh man final Agape meeting today, it's been four years and i'm just feeling really happy and blessed (and most of all, _secure_) with the direction that God's taking it. mr. barnett's been such an amazing mentor and advisor, and to all the future leaders next year, i am only more excited for you guys and what God's got in store for Lynbrook. let me just say that at times it's hard, tough and sometimes downright painful to live out loud at school but dood hang tight to God, seek His face every day and be secure in His love. i'm feelin' even more sentimental but i'm just slightly tired right now to write it down.. it's been a wild ride.
