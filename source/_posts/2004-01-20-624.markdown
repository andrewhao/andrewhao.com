pardon me if i'm feeling a little guilty today, my calculus textbook just cost my mother $143.16 buckaroos. my goodness.  
  
hmm.. the agape guys' sleepover on sunday was rockin' fun.. it was good to get to know some of the younger guys, pig out on junk food, battle it out on super smash, and have some awesome accountability time with each other.. that was definitely a blessing.  
  
i think my urge to blog is lessening.. that's super cuz i can cut down on my online addiction, and not-so-super cuz i feel like somehow if i don't write it down, i'm leaving some things unresolved somewhere inside.  
  
and hey, teen angst-- what's so wrong with it? and why am i not feeling any? awesome.

i'm proud to say that i shop at three respectable shopping institutions, twice a year:  
a) old navy  
b) the gilroy outlets, and best of all  
c) target!!
