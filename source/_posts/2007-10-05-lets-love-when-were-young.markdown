Let's love when we're young, and let our freckles shine in the dark. Let's love hastily and recklessly because we fear the cousins of the unknown. We might stumble and we might fall, but we have time, fearful, dreadful time on our side.

Let's love when we're old, and let our wrinkles count our bottled years. Let's love with the strength of a stout dam over steady waters, unmoved and unscathed. This is our reward, paid in the currency of regret, for we are no friends of time.
