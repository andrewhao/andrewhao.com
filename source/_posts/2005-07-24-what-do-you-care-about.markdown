...is what I asked some high school guys last Friday. They looked at their shoes and shrugged. "I dunno."

What are you passionate about, what gets you excited? I used to think that I wanted a standard Silicon Valley life. Life would be simple. Me, a high paying job, a wife, a Benz in the driveway, a couple of close friends and life would be goood.

What a waste of a life.

This year really got me thinking. I met people at Berkeley that were fired up for a multitude of causes. Environment. Affirmative action (pro, con, your pick). Women's rights. Political causes. Homeless outreaches. Urban poverty. Get Bush Un/Re-elected. Darfur, Sudan. Live 8. LiveStrong.

What do you care about? What can you give your life (or at the very least, a couple of your minutes) for? Sign here, sir.

I know I can't live a life just for myself, but I'm having a hard time getting myself passionate about anything. It's hard enough finding what cause to sign up for, it's harder to really give yourself to that cause.

What do you care about?

My psych and anthro classes connect to each other so much it's crazy...

Scheme is... useful! Check out [SDOM](http://www.nongnu.org/sdom/) and [SXML](http://ssax.sourceforge.net/), where they use Scheme for efficient expression-parsing, query commands and logic control for XML data. Shiver me s-expressions; who sez CS61a was for naught?
