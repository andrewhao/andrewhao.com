I've always kept tabs on hip-hop culture (although never able to immerse myself in it, for pretty obvious reasons). One thing that really bothers me is mainstream hip-hop's materialistic tendencies.

Kanye: "I'm like the fly Malcom X,  buy any jeans necessary"

Soulja Boy: "I got me some Bathin' Apes" (repeat x64 haha)

Run DMC: "My Adidas / My Adidas..."

Poison--but it does reflect something about our culture (hip-hop or not).
