hawaii was awesome and i'll post about that another time.. but there's something else that happened today i need to write down.

karen stringer showed up at school today to pick up her brother. she's come to CCIC a few years ago and now she's taking college advantage. seeing her in front of the school i took the advantage to catch up with her.

"how've you been?" i asked
"oh, family issues."
"like what?"
"my mom's expected to pass away this week."

whoa.

"she's got stomach cancer."

and yet she told all of it with a smile. that girl is strong.. she's always been. i can't begin to imagine how it's like inside, losing your mother then having to step up in her place.

hang in there karen. hang onto God and rest in the safety you'll find there. you'll make it, i know you will.

we went and saw jimmy chen off today.. he's pretty much one of the last college people leaving. you take care too man - have a blast and come back and cook some good food for all of us  8O
