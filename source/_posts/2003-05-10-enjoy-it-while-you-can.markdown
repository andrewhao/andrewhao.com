the hum of excited conversation at the dinner table in the other room rose and fell rhythmically. it penetrated my thoughts and fogged any would-be clarity in chem homework.

jocelyn skipped into my studies and gaped. in her 9-year-old hands she held a cup of apple juice. i glanced up and a split second later, returned to Bond Enthalpies and Co.

her voice interrupted my train of thought. "andrew, what's it like in college?"

i chuckled. "i'm in high school, not college." i must be getting old or something. or did she know something i didn't?

"ohhh." slight pause. "what's it like in high school then?"

i glanced at her and glanced back down at Bond Enthalpies and Co. what a question. you're a lucky girl and you don't even know it.

you've got more than you think you do.

enjoy your childhood while you can, kid.

a deep breath. i grinned as best as i could. "it's tough."
