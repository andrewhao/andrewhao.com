Hey everyone, I’m stoked to be leaving so soon! I’ve been telling people that I’m feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. Excitement to be embarking on such an adventure and nervousness because, well, who knows what I’ll find in store? I’m wondering whether this trip turns out to be a huge, life-changing experience or if this trip has more subtle effects in my life.

The other day, a friend was praying over us that we’d see this trip as a “signpost” in our lives. It was a good reminder to me to know that the significance of this trip is to give me just enough information to make the next step. I think that’s particularly pertinent in the confusion of this life stage when I really want to see the entire path from beginning to end. I’m learning to simply trust what’s been revealed to me. When I’m tempted to think of this waypoint as the destination, I’m reminded these signposts continue to appear through our lives point us toward Christ. And suddenly I’m not so fearful anymore, because I know our Father is faithful to show me just what I need to know at the right moment.

I’m definitely thankful to have you all praying for us and supporting us. Your words of encouragement and interest in our trip have really helped me see this trip as a “sending” action by our community, instead of “Sarah and Andrew’s trip.” That’s pretty cool, and I’m really glad to have you with us. We’ll be praying for you too; please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any prayer requests.

For those of you who are curious, we fly out from SFO on Monday (Feb. 2) at 1:15PM. We’ll be spending about 2 days sightseeing in London, after which we’ll continue on our way to Botswana.
