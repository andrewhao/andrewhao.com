this week's been pretty upbeat.. must have been coming with the end of those AP tests and the onset of senioritis.

we finished the second print issue of Vertigo yesterday.. haha it was hilarious because we had to beat the clock when the Lynbrook servers shut down at 4:30, so it was 4:21 and we were frantically doing last minute checks with people running around and calling out (unnecessarily, i might add) "NINE MINUTES LEFT!". and you know those bad spy movies where the bomb's about to go off and they have those cheesy timers on the bottom-right hand corner of the screen? well i kept seeing that timer out of the corner of the bad movie in my mind.

we beat the deadline, uploaded the files, then went outside to scream. yea!

tomorrow will consist of going to DYC for the [Call Extreme](http://www.callextreme.tk) vigil (i'm really excited.. i think God's gonna majorly show up). the prayer movement's getting started and when that gets going, some rockin' awesome change is gonna happen. i think God's moving already, got an email from preston at homestead yesterday and God's already beginning to move on their campus. it's crazy.

speaking of which, i'm going to be massively tired after prom. but it will be all good, because i have a magenta tie, and it looks so bad it looks good. looking forward to it!

 ;)
