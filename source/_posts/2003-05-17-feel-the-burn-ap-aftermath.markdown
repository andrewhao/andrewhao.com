this week has consisted of studying for APs, stressing for APs, taking APs, and trying to purge every single recess of my memory of APs.

phew, what an experience. but waiit, the ETS collegeboard drama has not ended yet.

yeah, i shelled out the big bucks for SATII chem scores.. yeah, my score's right on the border of "take it again, duh" and "its a keeper". so i'm gonna take it again. whoo.. if i score lower, i'm going to feel reallly bad.

hello ETS. sure, i'm cool with you taking my parent's hard-earned cash from their credit cards. and why don't you take my soul while i'm at it.

speaking of souls, we were in chem class today and discussing what to buy for our chem teacher (mr haywood).. it went something like this.

**judy: **what should we get mr. haywood?
**person 1:** how about a bunch of tissue boxes?
**person 2:** how about a lab coat?
**bart:** i'm gonna get him a SOUL.

meanwhile andrew menalienko got up and moonwalked across the room. yes, it was wild.

spanish confuses me.. it frustrates me beyond belief. gah i dunno.. i'm trying so hard and it eludes me - always within finger's grasp. my grades are nosediving.. i'm trying to keep my head above the water but i'm losing the battle..

but on a more positive note, the concert of prayer tonight at yg really encouraged me.. i guess God really allayed a bunch of my stupid worries that i had before.. maybe i'm just being impatient, maybe i've been blind to it.. but God proved me wrong. i love it :D

okay to end a totally pointless entry here tonight, i'll end with random rare spy photos never seen in any tabloid before. yow!
