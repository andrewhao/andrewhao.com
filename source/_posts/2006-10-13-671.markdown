Dah! In an allusion to my band geek past, I realize that I can't make it back home this weekend for the Tournament of Bands in my hometown. Worst part is that this crop of seniors holds a special place in my heart, (these kids were "my" frosh my senior year, and darn good ones (aside: where the heck did the time go?)). Ryan, Allyson, John, Brian, Dexter, Eunice, Anthony , I am deeply sorry =/
