biology AP test, what a monster but whatever i get, i probably deserve. last night was pretty bad, cuz once it gets past 3AM or so, no amount of caffeine or "taurine-ginseng enhanced" energy drink can save your eyes from glazing over and that primal urge to GET TO BED  :cry:

so about three hours into the test i'm staring blankly at bio essays I have no idea how to write. i figure, might as well have some fun with my readers. hence, was borne "Bio Limericks and other Bad Poetry" as i'm going to try to reconstruct from memory:

**Bio Limerick #1**
don't know much 'bout mutations
none of 'dat ATP phosphorylation
but as far as i go
and for all that i know
i need a Hawaiian vacation.

**Bio Limerick #2**
twenty three sandwiches, peanut butter jelly
in Bryan's bleached white overdrawn belly
but like a true weapon
it's secreting dat pepsin
and now's he's watching the shows on the telly.

**Love Songs for AP Readers**
(To the tune of "Yellow Submarine")
We all love our AP-Free-Response-Question-Readers,
our AP-Free-Response-Question-Readers,
our AP-Free-Response-Question-Readers.

We all love our AP-Free-Response-Question-Readers...
(et cetera)

_Question 4, part D. "Describe the relationship between anthrax and its symbiotic partner."_
Well, anthrax is pretty bad for the human body. I would hope that it's a parasitic relationship, but I'm probably wrong. It kills humans, evidencing the detrimental effects of this relationship. Yeah, I read once that it exists in the natural form in cows or something, I wish I read that article better. Too bad I didn't. Okay I'll stop trying to be cute.

my first and last time i attempt to be funny on an AP test. i talked with audrey kuo afterwards and she apparently wrote limericks on her test too! but hers are brilliantly, bloody funny. and a couple of people (adam gall included) just covered their sheets in random drawings. rock on.
