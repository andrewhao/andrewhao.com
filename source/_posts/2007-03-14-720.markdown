While the notion of doing something and being productive with every waking moment seems alluring and somewhat fulfilling, you know with your gut something about it is darkly wrong. Even rest becomes another figure in your calculations, something you plug in on one side so you can get more on the other.  
  
I'm getting tired of wringing the work out of every waking moment or calculating the costs and benefits of secondary activities at the altar of "Getting Things Done."   
  
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul.
