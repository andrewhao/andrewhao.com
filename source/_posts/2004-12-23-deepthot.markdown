I am a first class Chinese school dropout. And regretting every single bit of it.

You know what would be awesome? Caffeine-laced cereal. Talk about fun for all ages. Why hasn't done that yet? FDA regulations? I suppose you could always substitute Red Bull for milk.

This culture is so homogenized. As are most Asian nations, I suppose. Makes you really realize how different the USA is.

Politics here is a hot button issue. Everybody here feels strongly one way or another.

There's a certain flavor (stench?) in the air that can only be attributed to Asia.

I am feeling so terrible for my grandma right now. How does it feel to be aging and treated like a child, wheeled around with others telling you what you can and can't do, when you can and can't speak? She was (and is) so strong. You can see it in her eyes, but it's such a sad thing when her body's starting to fail her.
