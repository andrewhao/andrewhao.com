i hate to turn down people.. but i had to do some of that today. it was crazy hard to do cuz.. that's just not my thing. mom's bugging me about not taking on more than i can handle and i think i'm gonna have to start listening to her.

i think the stress might be getting to me.. i snapped at my parents today over some stupid issue over borrowing a camcorder from my relatives. in short: i'm wrong, they're right, and i realized how stupid i am when i'm in a bad temper. nobody's perfect.. especially not you, andrew.

**to all the seniors with high expectations for senior sendoff** i've got the water balloons taken care of, jack's got the finger paints ready. and we might not be kidding :xmouth:

it's awesome to see new christians grow in christ.. they're so amazed by every little thing they learn and they're so eager for more. man why can't i be like that every day? where's my thirst gone? where's the desperation?

took senior portraits today.. saw all the junior->seniors with last name Hs there hahaha.. i was driving there with my gas tank indicator BELOW "E" and i was praying that the place wouldnt be too far.. which it was. luckily i got there and back in one piece  :roll:

taking senior portraits apparently isnt as glamorous as i expected it to be. they just slip the tux "shirt" and the jacket over you (you don't even button it!) and you take pictures. some of the girls were going hardcore all over their makeup and everything.. i guess its a big deal but i didnt stress too much over it  :tasty:

its time for some more **mexico pictures** part 2:
