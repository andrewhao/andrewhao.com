most of yesterday was spent in preparation for junior prom.. hahaha so much for my plans to get anything else productive done. woke up at 11 feeling really nice (cuz i'd slept for like 45 minutes a few nights before) and, feeling lethargic, pretty much lay there staring at the ceiling for the next half hour.

if that doesnt feel good, i don't know what does.

er but anyways by noon all the phone calls had been made and the arrangements set. drove out to eli thomas to pick up the tux, then in a brilliant display of academic laziness, went over to kennedy to bball with the CIA guys.

okay, so the plan was to do homework after that but i guess _that _didnt happen (ha yeah right :roll: ).

so anyways sort of sat online just bein lazy.. chewin the fat and all that good stuff.

GKwong00 (3:59:01 PM): it should be fun...if everyone gets there on time!!!!
gsgninE: ahhaha
gsgninE: you know that aint gonna happen
gsgninE: its the law of prom

EugEnEmp3 (5:54:59 PM): ok
EugEnEmp3: i just talkedto jean
EugEnEmp3: and unsurprisingly for girls
EugEnEmp3: they are NOT ready
gsgninE: no surprise there
(note the time of this convo.. i was supposed to get there at 6PM. whoops  :red: )

gsgninE (5:27:16 PM): all right.. time for the 15-minute guy prep
gsgninE: wonder if i can set any records tonight
GKwong00: hahaha
GKwong00: go for it!!!!

hahaha but hey it all worked out in the end. dinner was great (florentine's in downtown saratoga - great atmosphere). at dinner with us were **jean, eugene, yvonne yi, max, andrea, tim, brian, ousi, janet, shuhei, amber **and** kenji**. good stuff.. it was a combination of good food, good conversation and wondering just what in the world goes on when all the girls stand up and leave to go discuss strategy or whatever it is in the restroom.

walked across the street to some cafe after dinner but it ended up sorta crowdedish? so then it was straight to the dance.. west valley college, despite the location, was very decent.. props to the officers for sprucing that place up very very nicely. the DJ guys were the same from wf.. not too bad i'd have to say and the dance itself was a lotta fun  :cheesy:

i think i'm still seeing lil purple boxes in my vision from all those camera flashes going on during the night.. seriously.

i could go on but i'm gonna wrap this up.. thanks to **megan **for the awesome time! the guys **garrick, hsiang, richard, charles** and everyone else were looking extremely slick.. and of course we've got to thank some supercool hardworking class officers for putting this all together.

i'm gonna find some time next week to get some video footage from last night edited.. finished my camera roll so i'm gonna get em developed and scanned soon.

and meanwhile i'm drowning tonight in history and chem and math and all that painful stuff. but i'm used to it.

super.
