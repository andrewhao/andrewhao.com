Head up, Andrew. Forward movement.





------------------------------------------------
I'm getting fat.
Well, not so much around the sides (although the handles are due to sprout come finals). But I'm talking about in every other way.

In every thing I have been blessed with, be it relationships, talent, wealth, et cetera.

And maybe even more so, spiritually. Hoarding my time with my fellowship, planning meetings, going to Bible studies, hours in the prayer room. And it's like.. flowers and daisies and roses (of course it isn't, but shoot eventually, yeah it is)

And I forget, shoot, I have _life_ (and to the full, too). And I'm just getting this picture of me stuffin' myself on a pile of good food and my metaphorical girth rapidly expanding and I keep sittin there pigging out while people around me are starved.

Freak. I want to share it but I'm paralyzed. Too scared to move out of the safe walls of my fellowship or church. Just wanting to stay in community for the rest of my life.

That first step is really, really hard. It's funny how the gears in my head really turn fast trying to justify why I should keep pigging out.

Until then...
