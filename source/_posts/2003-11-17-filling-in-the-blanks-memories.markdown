filling in on the last 2 weeks:

**college catharsis**: basically, i've gotten nothing done that's college-related in the wake of my stanford EA disaster. hahahha.. aye it's time to start again. UC app shouldn't be too bad, but then again my essays are cheesier than easy mac.. =/

it was cooolstuff to see college peeps back (well some of them at least) today.. post midterm trips i suppose :D oh man college has me a little intimidated. channing's warning me about stanford math, daphne tells me never to take UCB physics, and well.. with class midterm averages in the low forties, who can be a little scared? aye.

**academic aloofness**
okay so now i have 2 grading periods down, 1 to go right? time to bring back my flagging grades that fell victim to xc and mb. i can tell you that 1) it's a partial success, and 2) it's mostly failing. AP bio and AP english.. i'm not too sure. maybe i'm not expending enough study energy into those classes or whatnot but they require a whole new level of brainpower that i'm not used to. seriously.. you have your normal, slacker, i-can-get-away-with-this work effort that i'm so used to.. then you have the wring-your-poor-brains-out upper echelon grade A sort of thinking. i know i can do it, but it's just been so _long_ since i've done it. yeah, laugh at me. basically, i can't think hard. or at least i'm trying to.

**marching memories**
napa this year was wet. soggingly wet. hey, i didn't mind :P i'm going to follow with a stream-of-consciousness entry because that's how i remember this:

the parade was spared though.. marching down that street for the last time was pretty cool. singlefile back to buses, remember the time the first bus let off the brakes and coasted into the second? i was glad that i didn't get caught in between the two.

concert percussion @ the stadium.. missed our guys by 10 minutes but i heard it was pretty awesome. i felt really bad for them this year because they worked so hard, had some awesome drillwork and music but got edged out of placing. man.. the pit guys were really down.. ouch =(

parade awards: a lot of awards, a lot of waiting. haha for the first time (in my memory), lynbrook actually beats somebody in their own division. that is worthy of something, i don't know what.

it starts raining right about here, 3PM. on and off, hard and hardly at all.

field practice: that field was muddy as heck.. daresay worse than the lynbrook field. which made it even better =D i ruined some nice shoes and was proud of it =D even more than that i was proud of dexter lee for somersaulting in the mud and popping back up like it didnt even faze him. ahhh stud. end runthrough, we're back in the shelter of the tarps.

lynbrook hides out for a good two hours, feeding on grilled burgers and tomato soup. mmm... watery burgers. allen busts out sax scarves, we keep waiting. changing in the damp buses is definitely the stuff of memories, i can't say if they're good ones.

clarinets bust out the glowsticks. tis morphin' time. ponchos over uniforms, we're ready.

out to tennis courts for warmup under overhang (kinda). last time guys. i'm good to go. clarinets circle up, last words from everybody. we did it :D

flower ceremony 2003: emotional as always.. gosh i'm gonna miss this. four flowers, that means a lot. strange thing was that i didn't cry during the ceremony. i'd been expecting it for the longest time. it was more a sense of.. accomplishment. like what i helped contribute made a real difference. what four years of sticking it out meant to me. i was satisfied.. i think that's the best way to put it. not that i won't miss everybody.. it's gonna rip me apart, it really will. rain mixes with tears... but it's time to put on a show.

waiting at the stadium, watching homestead pass by listening to leigh. be careful of the mud, it's muddy, don't slip! hahaha i think we were a little cocky.. "can't be as bad as lynbrook mud :)" we were ready. goodlucks, hugs, clarinet celebration cadence.

its still raining. just like last year. we march out, tall, proud, ready. and when the show started, it was played as one. and as i marched, i was laughing. i was grinning. and i played my heart out, we all did.

back to the buses, packed instruments and back to stadium still in uniform. by this time we really didn't care for our scores.. we were satisfied with our last performance.. we were happy about it. (i apologize for cheesiness) i'm so serious. i didnt care how low we got judged, i was just in a state of happy delirium. a good thing, i guess.

lynbrook places 2nd overall, but the biggest surprise of the night was in the woodwinds caption. bellavista 89ish, leigh 95 and in first place..

by this time i'm like okay homestead, take it. i can handle it.

with a score of 96 - lynbrook high school! you cannot believe how shocked i was at first. heck, i'm still in shock. and i'm incredibly proud.

so that made my night.. that made my season. i can die in peace. back to buses, back to dry(er) clothes which were still pretty darn soggy and we all slept on the way back.

carrows was another last. waiteresses eyed us warily (we havent been the best customers the past couple of weeks :D) but it was fun. food, photos and goodbyes.

-------------------------------------------------
i'm done. it's done. this entry's done. long and hastily and poorly written, it is. but it's out. and i'm happy.
