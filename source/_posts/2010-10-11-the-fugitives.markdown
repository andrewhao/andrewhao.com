I dreamt the other night that I was running at midnight along the shore, no, there were cliffs, and we were running along the cliffs that wrap around the coast. The weather is warm, no, it has an icy bite, but we run anyways, out and around the shore, through silhouetted tree branches that bend in the breeze. Or perhaps they were shadows cast by city lights behind us. I can't quite recall.

I am running with someone, but I can't make out his or her form. I have my doubts though -- was I running with you? I was running with _someone --_

-- we run into the surf and laugh (or gasp, I think they are the same) at its violent warmth.Â In a few weeks I'll dream in greys again and wake up smiling, no, puzzled.
