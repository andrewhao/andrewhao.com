"It's weird," I tell a friend, "the longer we're here, the less we seem to care about grades."  
  
Flashback, 4 years: It's senior year and I'm pulling an all-nighter a week for sixth-period AP Biology. Why? I don't think I could have told you either.  
  
This year: I sleep. Even if I have a 10-pager and a oral tech pitch due the next day, I'm gonna get my sleep.  
  
A part of it is avoidance: I just don't tend to think very much about a letter grade. If there's one thing that my Dad's drilled into my head, it's the fact that "all you can do is your best". So at the end of everything, I ask myself if my work was reflective of my best effort within my boundaries of well-being. If I can answer "yes" to that, I am satisfied.  
  
Another part of it is understanding the Big Picture. I think I'm going to choose to trust in God's control of the world rather than be driven by fear--of being lesser than my peers, of not making it into grad school, of not getting that sweet internship.  
  
One last thing: guys, we're freakin' blessed to be studying here. What an amazing opportunity, being at the best public uni in the world (ok, give me a little slack with that statement). 99.99% of the world will never get anything close to what we have. (Aside: what are we going to do with this gift? I pray we don't keep it to ourselves.)  
  
It's been rather freeing, moving out of this paradigm of striving and academic bondage and into gratitude and security.
