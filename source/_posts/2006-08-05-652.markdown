I woke up this morning and the first thing in my mind was the realization: I am so satisfied.   
  
I'm simply loved by my Dad.  
  
I was talking to a good friend last night, and we were asking God, if you're real then why am I not totally in love with you - why am I so easily distracted?  
  
And for the longest time I was (and I still am) puzzled because my God felt like another scheduleable portion of my life. Or another place to sink some halfhearted efforts at playing the Christian game, then watch it all swallowed up by the monster called Burnout. But that was part of the formula, right? Mimeographable and rote. I couldn't shake the feeling that if I just keep following the twelve-step program I'd end up somehow with a decent semblance of faith and facade.  
  
if you Are, then show me. be my one and only satisfaction.
