before i go and start working, i think there were just two things that i needed to comment on. and yes, this is a definite sign of blog addiction.

pointless thought #1: **why do people work better with music on?** let me tell you, i'm the least productive person **ever** with the sound system turned on and when i attempt to do my homework. it's impossible.. especially songs with lyrics.. i cant wrap my mind around a concept AND listen to some song at the same time. there's always the fact that my subwoofer keeps pounding the ground. that would probably contribute huh...

the only exceptions are classical music and jazz. those are cool.

pointless thought#2: **the whole idea of a romantic ideal**. people keep making these lists of the perfect match for them.. the ideal mate. a list of absolute perfection of someone that they must be destined for. and i agree.. it'd be so awesome to meet someone like that. but when we dream up the ideal.. are we limiting ourselves? do we hold someone up against the checklist and go "not bad.. 10 out of 15.. (s)he'll do!" what happened to imperfection? does love follow a checklist? what if God wants someone totally different for me?

and where am i going with this?

nowhere. but that's not the point. and i dont know if i'm even qualified to be saying this: love exists where you dont expect it to.

alrighty.. got all that out of my system, on other topics - tony came back to visit in **agape **today.. oh man it was so awesome seeing him back again. he's as great of a guy as before.. and i can totally see he's still got the same (if not more) of that passion.

i'm feeling more of the taxi driver these days.. the downside of getting a license.

and the final thought today:
**am i obligated to go out for track?** on one side i'm excited.. not for the running but for the team experience.. hanging in the bleachers and just joking around during some meet. but on the minus side you've got the pain, you've got the workouts, the missed homework time, the constant fatigue, the blood sweat and tears and of course, the running. man its starting to sound like a no-brainer.. but do i have a choice?

garrick at school today: "it's in your blood!"
easy for a sprinter to say.

but its not that easy.. i guess from a runner's standpoint, something in me tells me i need to go out. something tells me i have to run. _"join us,"_ they whisper softly.

and this entry has gone far too long. and gotten slightly creepy.

all your base are belong to us.
