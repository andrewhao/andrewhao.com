so i'm sitting here and i'm listening to my parents talk about recent layoffs and how everybody's being affected. it's pretty scary.. a lot of my good friends and people that i know have parents that are losing jobs (or have lost em already). do you ahve any idea how hard it is to find a job right now in these times? aye.. this is really sad. makes me think about how crazy lucky i am.. **fortunate **would be the word.

my dad's optimisim (sort of?): "once everybody's layed off, then the companies will start making money and everything will return to normal"

that sounds almost.. harsh i guess? hahah but i know what my dad means. he's not a bad guy  :)

i was wasting hecka time reading xangas last night and i was reading a lot of them from new york and boston and philly and the big east coast cities and man.. if i could generalize the teens there i'd say they're.. um.. they seem sort of messed up. those guys talk about getting arrested and shoplifting and getting high (well that happens here too....).. jumping people and getting in fights like it's no big deal. dude i thought that all that inner city drama was just played up on the movies. i guess not. scary thing is that these would all be probably normal people if they lived in.. good ol san jose or something. a part of me feels really bad for them.

and the other part is feeling glad i'm far away from that kind of stuff. well.. i like to think that. (not so much any more.. man what's happened to us).

anyways those are the random thoughts for today. much thanks to my clarinet section (you guys are awesome) for getting the balloons and flowers for channing and me. had lots of fun fending off questions, yelling "no, it's not my birthday!" and "asking" girls to winter formal LOL

anyways got mucho hw to do, gg now
