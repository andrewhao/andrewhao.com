i overheard a conversation today where one of my friends was being discussed and it went along the lines of "i hate (insert name here)! i'm going to (insert threat here)"

okay, so i got the point that there was a little bit of animosity towards this person.. but what was said really shocked me. i guess it hit me on two levels.

this friend that was being discussed is one of the best people i know in every way. his/her (i'm not giving it away) heart holds only good intentions.. she/he's always got this smile for everybody to see and has always been genuine. so when this revelation came out.. i dunno.. i was stunned.

the other thing that stunned me was how cruel this world can be.. how vicious we can be with other people. i don't know.. what's at stake here? gah i HATE drama.. i hate to see drama between two people. i hate to see animosity and tension and just.. general badmouthing. i know it's something we've all grown up with.. something we've been taught. _if you wanna get ahead, then you gotta drag someone down._

and probably what was worse was my inability to stand up for my friend. i just decided to keep my mouth shut and not jump into the conversation. and that's really bugging me right now - would i want people to stand up for me as well?

and it just pains me to see this kind of stuff going on.. come on guys.. we're beyond this stuff. we can rise above all of this. seriously.
