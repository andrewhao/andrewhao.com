how my head throbs.

"we can't do this anymore," my piano teacher said to me today. "these lessons are killing me."

and it wasnt a surprise to me. i hadn't touched the piano all week and it showed.

the ringing in my ears began to intensify.

i stumbled over the next few measures.. and i think i just gave up. forget this, Natalia. i can't do this. i'm just a failure. don't bother with me. i'll never make your expectations.

the lesson ended on the usual negative note.

"are you coming to my concert?" she asked.

"huh?" what concert?

"this sunday i'm performing. are you coming?"

"oh.. i'm sorry.. i've got a group project to do....." it sounded so lame but it was the cold truth.

she shook her head. "you don't even listen to the music, how can you expect...."

she was disappointed. and my temples were really killing me.

i seriuosly wanted to go. i wanted to prove to her that even though i may be her worst student, i've still got a love for music. i wanted to be the most hardcore piano junkie at that point.

for years i think it was obvious to both her and me that i hated the piano's guts. that the only reason i was coming to class was cuz of my mom and her asian mom dreams.

but have i really acquired a love for the piano? look at me now.. i'm a total failure. what kind of student am i? failure.

i hate how it takes me twice as long as other prodigy students to figure out music. i hate how i can't sightread for crud. i hate how my fingers can never play the sixteenths as perfectly as i envision in my head. and most of all, i hate myself for not trying.

all i wanted to do was please her. please my teacher. please my mom. the piano and i? mutual enemies. and it can stay that way, thankyouverymuch.

but today may have been the final nails in the coffin of andrew hao, disappointment to the world.

how my head throbs.
