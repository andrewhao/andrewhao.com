I've been cleaning my room tonight, a heroic effort of massive proportions to clear the 15 or so years' worth of _stuff _that's accumulated there.

All those memories brought a big ol' grin to my face; old notes from a friend, Christmas cards, diary entries from the sixth grade, faded prom photos, that epic China trip, marching band awards, my clarinet mouthpieces, and the like.

Hardy Boys books, Charlie Brown anthologies, that weird spinning perpetual-motion trinket I got in some random store in Canada, a quickly-abandoned collection of pins from various tourist destinations, et. al.

AP books, a huge dictionary, chemistry textbooks (question marks scribbled in the margins), boxes of random junk only a 3rd grader could collect, fossilized Play-Doh, paper airplanes and long-dead AAA batteries.

These are nothing if trail markers into our pasts. One day we'll turn around and tell ourselves, look at how far we've come.
