there's exactly nine hours till i leave, and i'm feeling silly sitting in my cluttered room leafing through the photographs and reliving past moments when i know i should be packing. i'm not feeling silly because i want to keep every single one of the photos and bring them with me and proudly post them up all on my walls and frame them on my desk. nor is it because i know i need to be mindful of the space (or lack of it) in my new dorm room.

nine hours till home is no longer home, and i think the reason is because i'm afraid that if i don't, i'm going to forget you. all of you.
