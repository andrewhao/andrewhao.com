when you pray, **do you believe **in the power of your prayers?

i was talking to daniel lui today and he just reminded me again of the power and authority that we hold if we'd just take command of it. do we believe that our prayers have power? do we really have authority over Satan who's trying to take down every single heart on campus with addictions, depressions, false love and false hopes and dreams?

reminds me of my trip to mexico.. when we prayed for stuff it **happened** because we believed they would.

let's make it happen.. let's see hearts changed. an awesome revolution in our schools.
