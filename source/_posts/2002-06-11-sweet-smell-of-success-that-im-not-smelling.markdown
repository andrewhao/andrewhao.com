man.. i totally jacked up the finals today.

**chem**:
this is really too horrible to discuss.. and i wont really go into detail here. let's just say.. score one for morality, dock two for the grade. i managed to get kicked from bb.com cuz.. well.. i guess my answer to asano's question was too specific. sigh.. i guess that was really my bad call.. i cant believe i did that. i guess whatever points he deducts.. i deserved to get deducted.

it didnt help that i jacked my own lab, and managed to jack charles' lab too.. i accidentally threw out his solution of dissolving alka-seltzer.. how stupid can you get? and please don't answer.

let's not forget that on thursday flores gets to find out that i neglected to turn in my solid acid waaaaay back from titrations. i see death being very imminent.

i'm feeling majorly incompetent here.

okay.. i guess this one turned out better than it woulda. it was half listening comprehension, half reading comprehension. i felt pretty confident on the reading comp (sorta kinda).. but man on the listening comprehension? it was horrible.. the tape player was hecka old and he didnt repeat the sentences enough so i ended up guessing half of the answers (literally).

i guess i wont be able to get by on brownie points anymore.

haha.. what?.. we ran in the 90 degree heat (sounds like mr battaglia to me).. went swimming for a bit and turned in our lock. took my mind off of the previous fiascos of the day.

well.. i didnt do anything at home today.. first time in 9 months huh? it felt good.. sort of. um.. i guess i can really take advantage of this time.. maybe do some better QTs hm?

if i didnt have all this stuff on the back of my mind..
