Last week I sunk about 50 hours (14 of them were yesterday) into the fourth and final part of this operating system project (~150 hours total) and I must say, I may cry when this baby takes its first steps. Oh wait, there's a tear.  
  
Javier and Yu-Shuan's wedding was a blast. It is so amazing to see a relationship like theirs (with the cultural differences and personality differences) being lived out to God's glory. Wow. All the older figures in my life have been quickly marrying (Dave & Janelle, Bruce & Connie, Javier & Yu-Shuan...)  
  
I have an unusually chill finals schedule this semester. Mainly because my techs are project classes, and I really enjoy studying for my MC classes and writing papers. Trust me, when you've been this long on the other side of the fence...  
  
What a strangely wonderful semester. I'll tell you more about it... but give me a week.
