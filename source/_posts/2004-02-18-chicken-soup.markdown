break's been pretty good, i've been spending mucho quality time with my computers. such is the life of a nerd.

forgive me for boring you, but here's the lowdown: 1 fried mobo, 1 fried CPU, 1 new case, 1 reformatted drive on linux, 1 erased linux drive, about 20 gutted computer parts lying on the floor, 1 shattered dream, 2 sleepless nights, 2 ruined floppy drives, and uh, aw heck you get the picture. the plus side is that we may have the most wired family room in the neighborhood, not that that's a bragging point.

two years ago i went crazy about blogging.. i updated every day simply cuz i felt that i needed to log down my life to get it in order. i guess now i'm realizing even more now that i don't need to write it down to get it right. whatever that means.

i've been spending some more time getting reaquainted with the piano. it's a careful courtship (yeah yeah only i could bring romantic connotations into this) but this time i think i'm enjoying it more.. probably because i play what i want, when i want, because i want to. i guess that's always how it was supposed to be.

we spend the first 15 years of our lives fighting against the things our parents make us do, then take the next 15 realizing how good for us it was. again, i'm not making sense, but think of piano lessons, violin, chinese school, abacus (solomon brought that up today, good point), kumon math for those of you who took it, tennis lessons or basketball leagues or whatever.. our parents gave us the head start on those things, and i'm only starting to feel grateful for those things.

okay, moving on to track - here we go again. painful, yet this time i'm determined to do it right. i'm gonna eat right, work out right, run right and work hard, and i'm gonna break my stupid barrier in the half and one mile. watching some of the younger guys (who've been training in the winter months) burn past me kinda makes me wish i'd been working even harder. too late now, gotta make the best of it.

i'm working hard, academically speaking (i'd like to think that). my question is, should i be stopping? does the fact that i'm a second semester senior (that term's been overused and abused) mean i can give up cuz everybody else is? part of me wants to work hard so i can end up with a flawless academic record, straight teeth and a bragging right (which is one messed up motivation). the other side of me reasons that if i want to succeed in life, i need to learn to work hard. and if i don't learn now, i'll never learn it.

okay enough psychoanalytic babble, kite ogre zebra hurk funk bye
