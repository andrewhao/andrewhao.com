_God, we're tired of falling.

we're tired of tripping over and over on our own stupid mistakes.

we're tired of living underground.
      living lukewarm.
living unsatisfied.
               living unfulfilled.

we're tired of our pride.

we're tired of listening to expectations and obligations that burden us.

God, i'm tired.
_
how did that song go?
**"rise up church with broken wings"**
