i think what everybody needs once in awhile is a good blackout. the weather right now is crazy.. one moment it's pouring and windy and two hours later it's sunny. but basically we spent last night in pitch blackness.

it's right after the lights dim and flicker, then it's blackness and you're 150 years back before electricity. they say that when you lose a sense, all your other senses are heightened, and so you're left listening to the drumming rain pound the roof and feeling as if the house maybe isn't as sturdy or as sound as you always thought it would be. but then there's the scramble to light the candles.. and so as your family gathers around the candles you linger about them for a second longer - feeling that this isn't really a school night but maybe more like a camping trip. and so there in the warm candlelight glow, you listen to the rain and the wind and the cold pound away at your electric world but it doesn't matter - maybe the lights can be out for a little longer.
