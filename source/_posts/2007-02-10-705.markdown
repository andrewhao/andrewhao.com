Next week, in its entireity, is going to be a fantastic train wreck.  
  
I've held out for a bit on the whole podcast craze, but I think I'm relenting. So my cell phone has the ability to play MP3s, but it doesn't have the UI capabilities to (easily) add multiple songs to a playlist. So lately I've just been downloading podcasts (currently listening to [Scissorkick](http://www.scissorkick.com/)), cuz they save me the hassle of fumbling around for buttons on my phone. It's a control/simplicity tradeoff.  
  
So [in honor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTqk5W5_LkY) of Facial Hair February (this is legit), a couple brave souls and me are embarking on a journey to, well, grow our our facial hair for the month of February. Think of it as a celebration of hair. On the face.

I have never felt as much a traveler as I do now, longing for home (in the metaphorical sense).  
  
I still really want to be a graphic designer.
