so i had my brush with death today. okay it wasnt really a brush, it was more like a casual wave. okay, it was more like being in the same general vicinity.

westgate mall, 2:00PM. the air is still, the birds have stopped singing, i decide that two junior bacon cheeseburgers have not quite satisfied me yet. but i digress.

westgate mall, 2:00PM, stop sign. the Ford truck across from me has turned left, i start halfway across the intersection when i notice a white Acura Legend continuing right after the Ford. Inside the white Legend is a woman whom I have called Ms. Miss.

westgate mall, 2:00:03PM, halfway across the intersection. my Honda's already halfway across when whoa nelly! Ms. Miss must have been a little distracted. or maybe she's got some important business to attend to. Or maybe her house is on fire. I digress, again.

westgate mall, 2:00:04PM, still halfway across the intersection. Our cars are nearly kissing. The words "State Farm Auto Insurance" seem to flash across my field of vision.

westgate mall, 2:00:08PM. being the gentleman that I am (plus the fact that I dont want to be any closer than fifty yards of the Legend) I back up, and Ms. Miss, in her shiny Acura Legend, zooms off to keep her house from burning down, I hope.

westgate mall, 2:01PM, a parking space. I park, turn off the engine, and i think i'll sit here for a few minutes.
