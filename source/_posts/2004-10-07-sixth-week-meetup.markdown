school's rough stuff. there's been the initial hustle and bustle of welcome week and meeting tons of new people and the initial fascination and excitement of college classes, but a couple of weeks down the road and i'm feeling _beat_.

thanks, God. when life gets messy you tell me exactly what i need to hear.
