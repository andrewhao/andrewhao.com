Support us as we run for the IJM! I've opened up a donation link through an application called [Causes](http://www.causes.com). You can go ahead and donate via credit card as shown:


### [Donate to the cause online! Â»](https://www.causes.com/fb/donations/new?cause_id=631&fundraiser_id=911920&m=2799c)


We hope to hit our fundraising target of $**1000** by race day (August 3rd). That's only NINE days away. I'll be keeping you updated as the days go by. [Keep track of the cause via Facebook](http://apps.new.facebook.com/causes/goals/6633?m=9b018). Spread the word; let's do this.

Love yuh,
-Andrew
