All my life I've lived in the electronic! always-on! hyper-connected! world of the Future. I realize that it promises intimacy but cannot deliver. Get me away from these late night bright lights and cold screens. I wanna float about and explore inner space. Linger in the warmth of friends and simple conversations. Stretch out in the expanses of silence and there hear the inner voice of love.
