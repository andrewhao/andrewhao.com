In the interest of Wasting Precious Study Time, it occurred to me today at 11AM:

How does Hollywood cast fat people or ugly people? Say you had a movie script which required excessively obese actors or those of the not-so-attractive variety. Would you put out a casting call saying FAT PEOPLE WANTED FOR ROLE IN MAJOR BLOCKBUSTER or ARE YOU UGLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO PAY YOU MONEY. And how would you feel about taking the role? Attractive people need not comment.
