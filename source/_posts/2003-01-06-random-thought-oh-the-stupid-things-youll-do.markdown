i play random games with myself all the time. especially in the car.. man while you're driving, there are just so many mindless games you can amuse yourself with. there's the **"drive slower than the old lady" **game where.. not surprisingly, the aim is to drive as far below the speed limit as possible without maddening fellow drivers. there's the **"gas miser"** game where i try to push the accelerator as little as possible (and shift into neutral and coast whenever nobody's behind me)  :) and then there's **"hot brake pedal"** where the aim is to touch the brake pedal as little often as possible. this often involves releasing the accelerator a quarter mile before a red stoplight and coasting to a complete stop in front of bewildered pedestrians.

today, it was the **"don't eat the onion rings!" ** game.

picked up a King Sized??? onion rings after school from BK (okay.. so i broke resolutions #3-13 with this purchase but hey.. bear with me here). i walk out of the store, determined to eat as little onion rings as possible between the restaurant and my home.

i get into the car. _only four onion rings, andrew. four._ no problem right?

i fire up the engine and back out of the space. instinctively i pop a ring into my mouth. it disappears into the gaping black hole that is my stomach.

pulling into a red stoplight to turn into lawrence expwy, i grab another one. mm.. so good. onioney, oily goodness.

twenty seconds later, i can't resist the urge to grab another one. remembering a little too late that this is my third one, i slow myself down in time to realize that i've bit into half of the ring.
i chew. slowly.

the red light doesnt seem to want to turn green. and i've traveled about 50 feet so far, tops.

the next mile or so down lawrence expwy takes amazing concentration in ignoring the little rings that are screaming to be eaten. i pull off lawrence proud of my self-discipline. i pop another one into my mouth. **okay. no more.**

the home stretch. _a half mile to go._ i see my hand, in slow-mo dart for the bag. it enters... pulls out a ring..

i'm serious, this is an out-of-body experience.

it heads for my mouth.. my jaws open wide, mouth salivating for that salty, greasy goodness that is Burger King??? King Sized??? Onion Rings???.

_**NO!**_

in a final struggle with my inner fat guy, i force myself to drop the ring back into the bag. victory!

pulling into my driveway, i feel a new sense of confidence. i have passed the test. i have proven my true manliness. i shut off the engine and revel in the glory.

opening the paper bag, i glance at the remaining rings..

and leave no survivors.
