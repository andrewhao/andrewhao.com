[The Call LA](http://thecallrevolution.com/california/) went down today down in the Rose Bowl in SoCal.. man i'm really excited to see what God's gonna be doing. it's really an exciting time cuz God's really starting to move in so many different ways in so many different people and places. i don't know how to explain it.. but something big's gonna happen. pray not only for revival.. but for God to come meet us once again. there's been a sense that there's something bigger and something better out there. a new generation is rising up, one that is not stopped nor satisfied with what this world has to offer. we've only been scratching at the surface.

so come. we're thirsty.
