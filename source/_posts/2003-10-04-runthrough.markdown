i can't really describe it all other than it being a rollercoaster ride. so i've got to write all this down before i end up forgetting. not that you could end up reading it anyways but here we go..

**college apps**: the most important thing i've got to do according to mom (well besides relationship w/ God) and i've really really really put on the slacker brakes this year. seriously i've disappointed myself with the stupid stupid procrastination i keep falling into. my stanford early app is due in three weeks and i havent even started my essay yet. meanwhile uberstudent christine su is already on her 15th draft of each of her 19 applications to elite prestigious institutions. and meanwhile i've to start on my first..

my meeting with mrs. kleinman wasn't as.. bad as i imagined. you know i was expecting some sort of large object (i.e. ball peen hammer, anvil, baby grand piano) to fall on me (also known as "reality") during the visit and mrs. kleinman, notorious for reducing students' college hopes to dust, would stand there laughing and i would run out in tears leaving my backpack but not caring cuz i just wouldn't.

well it wasnt anything like that.. not too much anyways. let's just say that my chances at private colleges aren't so hot, but still warm on the griddle. whatever that metaphor means.

dah college. what am i still gonna do? i'm applying engineering (unspecific about the major) cuz that's totally something i could do and could have interest in. question is, is there something better i could do? "honestly, you won't know till you get there" mrs. loia tells me. and i have a feeling she's right. so whatever. put it all in God's hands and sallgood.

**inspiration** or the lack of it: where's it gone? i'm talking about my (creative) writing. i used to have a million thoughts and ideas running madcap in my head and i'd be able to create something beautiful (or at least i thought they were.. shaddap i know what you're gonna say =D) but the point is now the river's gone dry and i really wish it wasn't.

**school**: senior year lied to me. talk about your stress and your responsibilities and your pressures.. cuz all of that's come on me right now. it's fun, definitely, but it's just **too much**. being a senior is awesome, handling senior responsibilities is not. honestly my homework load consists of bio AP and english AP. every other class has virtually nothing. and the worst part is that i'm dying in those two AP classes. the teachers are great - mrs. baugher's got a passion for literature that passes onto us and mrs. loia's just fun to learn bio with but SHOOT it's killing me (and my grades).

**agape** i've been encouraged and burdened at the same time with this club. encouraged cuz i can see God working so much in people.. especially in the underclassmen members. morning prayers have been awesome cuz it's a blessing to see people with a passion for the people at school. i have to keep reminding myself why we're there. "not to us - to your name be the glory". the whole atmosphere in the club has changed quite a bit.. i'm probably wrong but i can feel a certain sense of excitement before each club meeting. God's moving at lynbrook and i think this is just one tangible evidence of that. praise God yo!

at the same time it's been a burden cuz satan's been attacking us from all sides. he's definitely sneaky.. and we're being divided in ways that never should've divided us in the first place. divided over stupid church issues.. over stupid little theological differences. satan's got nothin' on us but we need to know we have that sort of authority! we've gotta start fightin back and showing that sort of unity that makes us so effective. word.

i'm also going to confess that my priorities as a leader are not straight. if GOd is number1 in my life shouldn't my service to him be number one? bigger than homework, than marching band, than cross country, than homecoming. it sounds drastic but that's how it is. God's been putting it in my heart through several confirmations last week and i've gotta learn how to do that.

**youth group** the line between serving God and serving the youth group keeps getting larger and larger. i get stuck in these stupid little depression funks cuz i get frustrated with the progress of the group.. God where was the fire you promised you'd send? where's your generation you said you'd raise? i don't know.. i really don't. and i've honestly considered switching churches because i'm just not growing. dah those are Satan's lies though (that sneaky guy).. so Satan you will not have victory over anyone cuz God's claimed each and every one of us already. beleedat.

**marching band** i havent written about this in the longest time but i'm just impressed yo! we went through a sort of a slump (i guess that's how you could call it) a few weeks ago and it was definitely tough. but now we're closing in on competition season and shoot stuff is starting to look good. i know i havent been the ideal section leader so many times but if we stick this season out we're gonna be awesome yo! thanks to brooke su and liz park for organizing our chevy's dinner and to angela for letting us overrun your house afterwards =D frosh, you don't know what you're getting into cuz its seriously going to be a whole lotta fun.

**homecoming** okay so HC is about three weeks early this year.. putting it smack in the middle of college apps and SATs. doh! i honestly have to say that senior HC spirit is a bit lagging, and i'm not going to make any excuses for that but come on! we've gotta stay positive, know that what we have is awesome and just plain work hard. we have a full week till our skit kicks butt so let's bust it out in that awesome way that only 04 can do.

**hawaii + mexico part3** post still to come, i keep forgetting to write it.

annnnnd i know that you havent read half of this post but that's okay! in the future i'm gonna look back on this entry and laugh my head off. stupid first semester senior, oh how crazy those days were.

shaddap andrew get some sleep.
