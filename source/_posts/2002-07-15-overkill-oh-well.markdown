another six hours later and i've come up with a (sorta) redesign for the blog page. why do i do this, you ask?

um, that's a good question. but hey, its summer, so it's all good.

this morning some of us (eddie, channing, tombo, brett and i) went over to church to see our mexico missions trip guys off. got 40-so safeway donuts and said goodbye. haha.. hope they dont drink the water.. and remember to keep their wallets chained =P

walked into the lecture hall today to have the teacher tell us there'd be no lecture today! awwright! thats what i've been waiting to hear. well, okay she was sick. but hey, no lecture means no hw.

we had to still take the exam (which i thought was decently tough). i survived it though, and i wasted the remaining hour and a half in the computer lab doing who-knows-what.

came home and slept till 2PM. mm..
