my heart belongs to You
i'll never give myself to another
my heart belongs to You

this resonates tonight
no hay nadie como tu

I've always expected some point in my life where I'd get so frustrated with this life and this culture and these headgames and get to the point of denying God entirely, packing my bags and going (where?).

This week, I thought I was pretty close to that point. A crisis of faith you could say? I was ready to explode.

But maybe it wasn't what I thought it was, because instead of denying, all I felt was this inexplicable urge to run run run to the foot of the Cross and into the arms of my dad.

I'll elaborate more, if you'd ask me.
