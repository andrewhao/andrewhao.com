i was really disappointed today during the xc meet.. ran a totally horrible race in the JV division too. aw man.. i'm really sorta bummed out. one one hand everybody tells me it's cuz i'm injured, cuz i'm outta shape and blah blah.. but on the other hand i dont think it was supposed to be THIS bad.. bleh.

i dont know.. i dont handle failure very well. i guess it's sorta good cuz it drives me to do better..like how i'll have to work out over the weekend like crazy for leagues on tuesday. BLAH.. i dunno.. this wasn't unexpected but why do i feel so bad?

going to a harvest festival over at my church (and to escape all those lil kiddies in scary costumes).. i dont know how i'm gonna do my hw tonight cuz it involves computer work and the computer room is right up at the front of the house. agh.. go away scary little people. let me do my homework in peace..  :cry:

ack.. they're here.
