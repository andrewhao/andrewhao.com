These past couple of days in London have been a blast. Yes, we know we're on a missions trip to Africa (yes, we're on the wrong continent), but whoa, Jesus gave us a good gift in seeing one of the coolest cities on the planet along the way, too. By the way, did you hear of the [snowstorm this week](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100174144&ft=1&f=1004)?

We really appreciate all the encouraging words and prayers you've been sending over. We're hanging out in Dubai now on a layover to Johannesburg… will update when we get a chance!
