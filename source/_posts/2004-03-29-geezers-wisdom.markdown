i've been asked a lot lately what classes i'm taking senior year by various overachieving, underachieving and just-in-between juniors. you speak of SAT and AP this and that and A and B and C. i have two things to say:

1. don't let college consume your high school life. you're missing out on so much.
2. regarding classes, know your limits and do what you're interested in.

yep. that's trustworthy geezerly advice.

i'd like to respond to karen wang's comment about the previous post a couple of days ago. she wrote:

_People don't think that about girls who never did use make-up to transform themselves.  It's only when you've changed, and then changed back that people think it's "sweet" that you're "genuine."  But if you're "genuine" all along, people just ignore you.  I've seen too many people ignored because they stayed themselves._

and that is so true. kind of sad, isn't it?  :( thanks karen for bringing that up.
