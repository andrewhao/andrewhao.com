so my final lesson with my piano teacher was today, and there was something about it that felt so **final**.

i dont think i'd ever felt so **free **while playing.. something inside me sort of unlocked. yet at the same time there was a bit of regret and doubt. aw man.. i knew i'd start to regret my decision to take a few months off, but i **didnt know it'd start so soon**.

i saw a different side of her today.. for perhaps the first time in a long time, i could see that she **cared **about how i played. she cared about my skill and my talents.

see for the longest time i figured that she must have hated me by now. i mean, what student **practices so little **and comes to lessons so **unprepared**? i'm practically the oldest student in her studio.. and here are these younguns who quite possibly kick my butt. to put it this way: i **was a disgrace **to her, and i understood that. it wasnt fair to her for me to subject her to **frustration **over me.

"andrew, maybe you just don't have the patience to sit down and practice. is that the reason?"

i admitted to that. wholeheartedly. truth is that the real reason i needed to take a leave of absence from piano was that i hated to practice.

i hated to see that i couldn't master the melodies that somehow miraculously flowed from her fingers. i couldn't perfect the rhythms and dynamics and the _feeling_ of the piece to do it justice. i'd sit at the piano for **hours **sometimes, banging out the same uninspired melodies, each progressively worse than the previous. it got to the point where i was exhausted by it.. somehow i could not find the **source **of the music within me.

and so i gave up.

today, i will completely give up. i have to. there's no inspiration to be found in merely touching the lifeless keys. there's no joy in frustration.

i once remembered playing a Copland piece that was so impossible to master but i loved how it sounded. every single keystroke, every chord and every melodic progression i would revel in the genius of the music and marvel that i was creating it. it may have taken a whole year to master, but i did it. and i **loved** it.

today, i will completely give up. cuz somehow along the way, i lost my inspiration.

after the lesson there was an awkward silence between us. i got up to leave. staring at the floor, i could only muster a barely audible "thank you".

"good luck andrew. i hope you will want to come back again."

and at that point, i wanted to hug her. i wanted to thank her for putting up with me for all my four years with her.

but **how can you hug **someone who's **torn you apart?** left you hurt and near tears on numerous occasions? ripped apart your self esteem?

_no_, i told myself. not today. i couldnt let myself do that.

i need time to change myself. i need time to reevaluate.

and i'm sorry to those of you who read this entry and have no clue what i'm talking about.. i just needed to write this out to myself.

there's so many sides to me.. the happy-go-lucky guy you see at school, the comedian, the studious nerd.. the overemotional weenie... the insecure lil kid.. and sometimes i'm not sure who i'm supposed to be.

and this post just got way off topic. but yeah, point is that these are some of the tough things you gotta do in life.

_let it go._
