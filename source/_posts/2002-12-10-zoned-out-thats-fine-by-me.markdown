i have no idea what i was thinking last night.. when i thought i could finish hw, sleep 1 hour AND go to school and be fine. phew.. i've never gone to school this tired before.

maybe **"gone to school" **is too broad.

more like.. showed up in class, conked out and drooled on himself.

yeah.. should'nt have even bothered with sixth and seventh period. i have no idea what happened in those classes.

GsGniNe: well.. maybe a bit on the sleepless side
G: you saw me in spanish
G: snxxx
S u K i yaki 27: HAHAHA
S: IT WAS SO CUTE
S: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
S: SO CUTE HAHAHAH I WAS LAUGHING
S: ASJHFDLHJASFH
GsGniNe: and i was like.. did someone just say my name?
G: oh that was bad
S u K i yaki 27: ASFHAHa
S: it was SO cute
S: you werel ike sleeping with mouth open
GsGniNe: okay.. you can stop now
G: dont need to point it out :-)
........
GsGniNe: by the way, that's also a good way to drool on your arm

it rained today.. which made me kinda mad cuz i washed and waxed and cleaned the car this weekend just to have it rain today.. bleh.

in lit class we finally presented our lit video. we brought in a laptop and two sound systems (we figured going all out was the only way to justify spending all that time video editing  :) ) one of thse days i'll post clips online for all of you who've asked. i was also surprised that none of our speakers blew out cuz i was listening to my sub thump and it sounded like it was distorting.. so thank goodness nothing blew.

got home and conked out for five or so hours. woke up at 9 and thought it was like 3AM.

sleep cycle? dead. brain? dead. andrew hao? dead.
