andrew sat in wide-eyed stupor in front of the computer, jaw agape. the internet explorer icon on the upper right corner kept rotating, mocking him in all its microsoft-branded splendor. yet nothing happened. 5 seconds. his screen remained a blank white, and andrew remained unmoving.

**we now take a break for our unannounced programming of Really Bad Analogies:**
_it was as if he'd gone to 7-11 and ordered the monster sized slurpee (the 64-oz bigun) and filled it up completely with every single flavor that the slurpee dispenser offered (applying liberal amounts of Coca Cola and Pina Colada flavoring, respectively) and taken a sip through the extra-long straw, realizing all but too late that he had left his wallet in the car before the brain freeze set in..._

**and now back to the regularly scheduled programming:**

10 seconds. this was getting bad. his heart began pounding. 15 seconds.. and the screen flickered.

"This page cannot be found"

he tilted his head back and screamed at the heavens. well actually it was more like the light fixture in the low ceiling right above him.

but ladies and gentlemen, the question now stands:
_how can a poor guy survive without his subprofile?_
