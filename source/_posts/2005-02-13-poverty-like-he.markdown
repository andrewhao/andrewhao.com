Back from the Jesus, Justice and Poverty conference this weekend living in the SF Tenderloin district and there are no easy answers, no tidy solutions.

Post later.

I am amazed at how far each of you have gone. You've asserted yourselves, expanded upon your accomplishments, matured just a little more, found your identities (or if not, you're getting there :)) and you're tearin' up the place. Proud of each of you.
