JJS with Intervarsity folk tonight was awesome. i've been broken down by finals and stress and the whole shebang recently, and then just meeting God through worship felt like restored intimacy tonight. and the whole theme of this week for me was just coming back. abandoning all the stupid extraneous stuff i've been stuck in and just running back and just being so **secure**. it's hard to describe, but it's been keeping me going.
