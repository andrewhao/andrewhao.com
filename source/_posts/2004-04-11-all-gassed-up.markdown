DISCLAIMER: there is no practical value in this entry. that won't stop me, nor should it stop you.

so i was pondering the deepest darkest secrets of my life as i was driving around my neighborhood yesterday, wondering such elements as _what is the direction my life is taking? why was condoleeza rice so reticent yesterday in her congressional testimony? why is there such evil in the world? and does daylight savings time really save any time? (it's all the same to me except i'm crankier in the mornings)_ when i snap out of my psuedo-philosophical daze to see an orange light blinking on my dashboard. on-then off-then on-then off.

**RELEVANT (KINDA) TANGENT: **there also happens to be this other orange light on the other side of the dashboard, yelling "MAINTENANCE REQUIRED" at me every time i crank the engine. (first time i saw that light i called my doctor's office and asked them to schedule another checkup exam for me, just in case my car knew something i didn't. all they found was a buildup of earwax in the left ear, and even i thought that wasn't too much maintenance required.) oh yeah, well that was last year and so far my car hasn't fallen apart or spontaneously combusted. yet. that orange light's still there, so i guess it's time to get some earwax removed.
**END THE TANGENT.**

so there's this orange light, and it can't make up it's mind. i try to make out the symbol on the light; it's some sort of computer screen on a pedestal with a gas filler thing attached to it. my first thought is _what's mom making for dinner?_ and my second thought is _why is there a gas filler thingy attached to a computer monitor?_

eventually through much debate and phone calls to local government officials, it is decided that the light, indeed, indicates that my car is low on fuel. _now that's a novel idea_, i thought. _maybe i should get it filled up._

**RELEVANT (REALLY) TANGENT:**
when i was young i used to be freaked out of gas stations, always wondering where all that liquidy combustible substance came from that pipe thingy that you plugged into your car thingy. and the fact that it smelled worse than a furniture shop, and just dreading my time, many moons in the future. and i remember the worst part would be when i would have to WALK INTO the cramped pay register filled with dirty junk food and actually TALK to the guy behind the counter. the time would come when i would assume my responsibility as a man and (say this in a low voice) fill up the gas tank.
**END THE RELEVANT (REALLY) TANGENT.**

so if you haven't dozed off already, let me give you a brief insightful recap: i was driving and the gas indicator light came on.

_but wait_ said the All-Too-Knowing voice inside my head. _you've probably got a couple of gallons left in the tank._

**YOU'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF GAS IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME DESERTED FOREST ROAD WITHOUT ANY PHONE RECEPTION AND GET EATEN BY WEREWOLVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT** said my Inner Phobic.

"wait," i said. "werewolves only live in Kentucky, didn't you read the article?"

**OH** said my Inner Phobic. **NEVER MIND THEN.**

All-Too-Knowing Voice jumped back in. _you've got a bunch of errands to run still, and heck, you don't even have mom's credit card on ya._

"that's right," i agreed. "you could not be more correct."

_so why panic now? you think you're gonna let this stupid light dictate your life?_

"that's right," i agreed, the pride puffing up my chest. "i am not going to let this light run my life."

_you are ANDREW HAO. you are a MAN. you are SELF SUFFICIENT. you are CONFIDENT._ All-Too-Knowing Voice rose to a shout, and i could hear the first strains of _Hail to the Chief_ playing in the background.

"wait, actually i'm a little weak in the self-sufficiency department," i meekly replied. the music stopped.

but hey, All-Too-Knowing Voice had a good point. i felt pretty good actually, knowing that this gas-pump-attached-to-a-computer-monitor light was merely a SUGGESTION. why was i panicking? and hey, it felt pretty good to tempt fate and live life on the EDGE. and i would be sure to visit only the cleanest of Shell stations where i would administer TLC to my poor Honda, even wipe the bug carcasses off its bumper.

my inner reverie was interrupted again. _now i'm getting hungry, let's get to that Jack in the Box._

i took the u-turn, and made a note to grab a couple extra jumbo jacks.
