So call it the naivete of the young, but isn't life supposed to happen in _the city_? Weren't we supposed to defy the Man and his associate powers-that-be by living bohemian lifestyles, wandering from metropolis to metropolis, drinking in the flavors and colors and noises of life?

You know what I mean. Weren't we meant to be young forever, crashing at friends' places, taking road trips, wasting long hours in front of the TV? I thought we were going to lounge our afternoons away in coffee shops talking epistemology, Burmese politics, predestination, the Warriors. I thought we were just going to cruise the dazzling coast on the days we felt like it, our feet heavy on the gas pedal.

I've managed to lump all of my fears of the future together and project them into the idea of _going home to suburbia_. Honestly speaking, it's less about suburbia than it is about going home. Going home validates some sort of regression in my life. It marks an end to all of my relationships. It means returning to a hazy, somewhat unresolved future.

But the _city_, man, the _city_. The city is sexy. The city is full of life and enticements and activity and things to see. The city is Far. The city is full of wonderful strangers. The city is everything home is not.

I hate anticipating the future, describing my life and my plans in fifteen words to people I honestly don't know if I'm going to see in a year. That uprooted feeling makes me nervous, but more so the feeling of _going back_ to my roots. "So this is it, huh?" I fear telling myself next year. "This is my fabulous life."

No, no, no! I know that my happiness isn't determined by where I live or what I do. I know this in a spiritual sense (I am reminded of dreams I used to have, dormant now). But these fears still manifest themselves in the idle hours between classes, at red lights and in the minutes before I close my eyes at night.

Maybe a routine isn't so bad. Maybe the 9-5 grind isn't all that hard to work out. Maybe I'll like the mazes of paved driveways and well-manicured lawns. I think that appeals to Domesticated Me. And heck, who's kidding who? I've always liked safety and comfort. That won't. be. so. bad.

Does going home mean drabness and 9-5 prisons? Does going home just mean sucking it up and growing up? Does somebody need to smack some sense into me? Where is the _joie de vivre_ in monochrome suburbia? Tell me, because I keep seeing myself there and I have a feeling it's what I think it is.
