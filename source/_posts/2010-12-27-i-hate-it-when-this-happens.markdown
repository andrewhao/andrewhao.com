I just came across this verse (1 Peter 4:8) and realized that God was rocking me with it. I mailed it to the other interns (text: "bah!") because they know how hard it is for me to serve people I don't get along with. But... like [Justin mentioned the other day](http://themarrow.wordpress.com/2010/12/14/lust-prayer-pain/), what if we changed our attitude a little?


> The thought that hit me was: what if, instead of this grumpy and hard to love person, it was a female I was attracted to that had this need? Man, the reaction would have been COMPLETELY the opposite. Even if I didn’t have my own computer, I would be searching high and low for any way to fulfill that need… And not even necessarily for someone I really loved or truly cared about, just some girl… This was convicting.


What if we could love people in that way? Of course, we love the difficult people that we're called to love, that are "in our bundles" -- we can't love everybody in that manner. But what if God was calling you to love someone difficult?

But on the other hand, it's kind of reassuring to also identify with a church whose natural tendency was to grumble. And I'm learning to set a boundary on my love -- to say no when I'm honestly not ready to love someone, but also to say yes and take a risk that someone just might receive it well.

Regen, let's choose to love that way.
