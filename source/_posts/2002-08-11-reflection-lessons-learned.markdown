well i guess from the stupidity of yesterday.. i've got a few lessons to learn. care to go over them with me? hm.

a.** be more careful with your stuff** yeah i know.. sometimes im just not careful.. sometimes all logic and caution goes out the window. gotta stop that.

b.** you're never thankful for what you have till you lose it** or however the saying goes. tru dat. i never really realized what a privilege it is to drive. now that i'm licenseless.. hehe.. my poor mom has to chaffeur me around for the next few days or so till i can get to the DMV. yeah.

c.** attitude check** gotta start realizing that all my stuff.. my talents and belongings were given to me by God. this isnt my stuff.. and i gotta realize that. something i just gotta get through my thick skull.

anyways.. im gonna be pretty busy tomorrow (car-less) XC practice at 9AM (running there and back) and band meeting at 11AM to whenever (biking/running there and back too). YSP at 1PM to 4 and guess what.. i'll be running there too -_- wahh.. appt with DMV is tuesday for re-registration of a license. bleh.
