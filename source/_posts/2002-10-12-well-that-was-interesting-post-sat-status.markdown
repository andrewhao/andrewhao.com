i woke up this morning with my face in my SAT book.. and judging by the way my brain operated this morning i think none of my pretest cramming helped much. the test this time was.. a bit more formidable. well.. i guess it wasnt too bad.. but i didnt feel as confident as i had last time. ah well.. hopefully a few select (ahem ahem) nerds didnt screw up the curve THIS time  8O . hahaha.. but yeah. i'll feel really bad if i end up getting a lower score than May.. but somehow i won't be surprised. oh well. there's always January.

TOB is tonight! please come watch us @ CHS @ 7:30. unfortunately SATs caused me to miss practice this morning (and a few other people too) so we're gonna kinda be a bit shaky on it. i dont think it could be as bad as our football game performance yesterday though..

oh yeah.. my wallet and keys got stolen yesterday. AGAIN. MANNNNNNN i feel so bad about it.. sigh.. i'm just a bonehead.. my fault my fault. and my dad's not too happy about it either (but he seems okay today). andrew hao: screwup of the century. thank you.
