my small group held a thanksgiving dinner for many people today. many many people. i was with foodmeister jon akutagawa and allie hu much of today preparing food. let me tell you that a) i know so little about good food and b) good food means lots of preparation and c) lots of preparation means lots of work.

sallgood because there were many people fed and it was a jolly rockin good time. now i am on a full stomach and i am thoroughly exhausted and ready to take a fat nap right about now.

man i am (we are) blessed beyond belief.
