I've been feeling a little (asymmetrical was the first word that popped into mind, but not quite)... unbalanced lately. Much like waking up too fast, or like the realization that you've been walking around with an unzippered backpack.  
  
I think unsettled may be the word. It's not exactly it. But I think I've been out of consistency for a bit too long.

Yesterday was quite the exciting.  
Nearly got T-boned at an intersection (in Fremont, of all places) by three cars running a red light.  
Putting out fires at the office (metaphorically speaking).  
My heart rate was up and palms were sweaty for the rest of the day.  
Thanks, God. I think I'll walk the earth for one more day.
