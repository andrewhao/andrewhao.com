It's official! I'm also a declared Mass Communications major! The process was about 100x easier than I thought it would be.

I like the idea of being in two majors, simply because it's totally exercising the left and right hemispheres of the brain. It's getting the full spectrum of my overpriced university education. But it is exciting to think that I'm going to be taking awesome psych, communications, english and whatever classes ALONG with some freakin sweet EECS classes (the latter is an utter lie).

I don't like the idea of this because it's reason to get all prideful and proud of myself in some sort of academic prowess or whatnot.

Hm.

AAHH! [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) gets me so excited I could pee in my pants. Thus summer I want to give it a try. Oh, geekdom.

In further "geek news that will never come to pass", I would like to port this blog to a stronger and better supported backend, namely [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) or [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.com), or if I'm excited enough, to a Rails-driven app I'd like to try building myself (nah..). If all the big boys are doing it, do as they do...

"Hey little sister
Why do you cry?
Holding your head so low,
May I ask you why?

"Don't you know that He loves you?
Don't you know that He cares?
He will never leave you, no,
And never leave you there.

"'Cause you are perfect
You are perfectly,
Perfectly done."
-Shawn McDonald - Perfectly Done

This song has the hook I was trying to come up with over winter break. Take a listen. Simple yet... powerfully done.
