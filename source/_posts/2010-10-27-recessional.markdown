Autumn is blazing in San Francisco; its fiery oaks defy the growing chill. I am biking the Wiggle, the well-known route from Market St to Golden Gate Park that all cyclists here know. It is the kind of route that is knowingly passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition; the route is now marked by street signs, garishly set to large print to guide clumsy bike-riding tourists to their destinations. Right-left-right-left-right-left--I slam on the brakes--a Muni bus nearly clips me as it makes a right turn.

San Francisco is a city I love and a city that, now that I'm no longer there, lives adjacent to that space in my head reserved for nostalgia. As such: the scent of dewy redwood groves, the family vacation to Big Sur when we were all crammed in the minivan and Dad couldn't find that one hotel so we drove for hours until we ended up turning around and driving all night back home and I lay half-sleeping in the front seat listening to him sing to himself, the fearful arrangement of piano keys, that long walk to class with Lesley (my elementary-school crush, the one with the silken hair), looking up at dark clouds and smelling the dampness of impending rain.

It's the kind of morning that slaps you with its chill, but seduces you by warming your extremities with gentle sunshine and crisp air. Children are clamoring over the steps of the Conservatory garden, some settling in groups of twos and threes content to gossip over television shows and pop stars. Others run over the lawn, drinking red hickory air. Parents, their faces belying exhaustion, labor to bring out school-boxed lunches. A pair of blue-eyed girls, mischievous as they come, grab an unsuspecting boy's hat and toss it down a hill.

He gets up, his face registering confusion. "Hey!" A hesitant half-smile grows on his face. "Where did you put it?" I look closer; he clasps his hands in the awkward fashion that little boys do.

"You have to run down and get it!" they twitter. He turns, visibly dejected, and slowly pads down the hill. I imagine him picking up the hat (a shy smile lengthening to span his cheeks, a laugh hiding in its corners) and taking off, running.

I can feel chimney-smoke envelop me and my memory churns: Was I too fearful to look Lesley in the eye?--the Number of Bay Area Bike Fatalities has Increased Twenty-Three Percent over the Past Decade. Fell-Scott-Haight-Pierce-Waller-Steiner-Duboce (For-Sure-Hannah-Played-With-Sand-Dunes)--Dad and I got home at 2AM that night (but what was it about Lesley?). I remember feeling the rough-hewn edges of my dad's five o'clock shadow, wishing for his strength. The Wiggle was carved by years and years of rushing water; the Conservatory is made of tooth-picks.

Autumn is summer's swan song; a bridge one crosses once youth is spent. It never arrives, only passes, lodging itself beneath the consciousness. Later that day, dodging buses, I let out a gasp. The air is nippy. I am that boy.
