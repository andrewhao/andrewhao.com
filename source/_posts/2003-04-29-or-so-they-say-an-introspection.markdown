they say that i'm too passive. that i don't spend enough time pursuing the relationships i want. they say that i sit there, just being wishy-washy all the time and doing nothing to take action.

well actually, nobody says that but the critics and analysts buzzing inside my head.

in a major way i've been introverted from the start.. just a quiet kid who never really liked to draw attention to himself. i never really minded being alone in elementary school (not that i was.. but when i was, i didnt mind ;) ). i guess that carried on into junior high when i was trying to find a group of friends that suited me.. i never really cared about the popularity mold and i guess i was blessed to find friends that, no matter their social status or academics or whatnot, saw me in the same light of acceptance.

but at the same time i kept those relationships pretty distant, myself not really being one to open up to other people. so i guess i was playing it safe: easy, on-the-surface relationships that couldnt possibly hurt me.

but why? perhaps it was the fear of the commitment. perhaps it's because it was oh-so-much easier to free yourself from obligations. or perhaps it was because i just didn't care. who knows?

but as time progressed and as i moved on into high school i decided to change myself. i resolved early on in freshman year to make my friendships more meaningful, to relate to people no matter how ugly, painful or offensive their personalities or their problems were. taking some leadership responsibilities also required me to relate to more people and to show that i actually cared. and to some extent, it worked out.

but mostly, i held myself back. i withheld a certain part of me that i couldn't see myself sharing. and so i ended up carrying smiles on the outside and a weariness on the inside. and on the days that the weariness got to be too much, i shut myself down.

thank God i've found some bros in Christ to really start sharing and be accountable with... honestly those relationships are the ones that i can be brutally honest and open and vulnerable in and yet its still all good.. those are the ones where i feel safe. these (and a lot of my good friends) are the ones who will initiate a conversation, a relationship with me whether i like it or not. and in the end, it works out.

i want to thank those of you who are the initiators. i know it's tough always having to pursue the relationship and i really apologize for the days when i'm feeling passive.

yes, they say i'm passive. and you know what? they're right.

but i'm working on it  :D
