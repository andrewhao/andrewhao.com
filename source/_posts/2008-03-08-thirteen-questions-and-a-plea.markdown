I've been wrestling with a lot of identity issues and insecurities lately. I've invited them all to run amuck in my mind. Among them:

Who am I? What are ways in which I hurt others? What do I need to change about myself--and what things can I stand confidently in? Am I a bad student, boyfriend, leader, bro, son?

Then these questions invite their friends over:

Where will I be in a year? What are my passions? How do I navigate the tension between doing what I love and doing what's right and doing what's safe (not that they're mutually exclusive)? Will one come at the expense of the others? Can I mature and still have dreams?

And soon it becomes a Veritable Reunion:

Is it healthy to let some relationships taper off--even before it's time to say goodbye? Am I emotionally distant or am I just trying to cope? How do you sew a button onto a shirt? Who will I know in a year?

Hey, God. I just want to know that you love me.
