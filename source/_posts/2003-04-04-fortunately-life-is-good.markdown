kind of hit me today how good i've got it.. i guess i've bubbled myself in so much living here and working so hard that i never really stopped and asked myself how much i've got.. and how appreciative i should be  :D

track meet at toga was nice.. in that i was expecting something horrible (my shins and pulled thigh being the way they were).. but i guess i did all right. pretty much back of the pack with a 5:21 1600m.. that's decent i guess. gotta work myself without screwing up my body.. goal for this season is 5:0x and (yeah right) sub5? gotta work for that. congrats to jason whitsett with a PR, eugene berson for finally going sub5 this season and superstar kid luis jensen hitting up a 4:50? charles chen you blew my PR away  :!:  props props props.
...crazy kids.

@wilcox: oh please oh please charles please can i be as cool as you?

ton of hw tonight and i can only stare at the comp screen. haha gotta get a move on.

**the call** is going down tomorrow @ candlestick.. but more than that is how God's totally moving to bring this together, whether it be through some pretty darn miraculous breakthroughs with financial problems and/or with the city of SF.. what's happening is really awesome to see. i encourage you to GO!

this is really a cry for God in a generation that really needs it.. i really feel the same way that daniel lui is feeling.. that this is more than just an event or just a concert. this is gonna do something major guys.. in a way that i can't explain or describe but i can only hope for. this is a call for a new generation of on-fire youth.. God's presence is gonna bomb on the Bay Area and ya don't wanna miss out!

(got SATs? then go afterwards! ask around.. people are organizing post-SAT rides ahhahah)

er anyways my chem hw is calling my name.. blargh. redox reactions own. me.
