this entry has nothing to do with hamsters. i like this picture, though.

i was driving on central expressway today and i found myself being passed. viciously. by old ladies in toyotas, young men in rice rockets, and the rich and the infamous in their BMWs.

so i was a little lost but still driving the speed limit. ever felt that pressure to just drive faster when somebody's tailgating you? well today i drove scared, half glancing up into the rearview mirror to check if that Mercedes had backed off a little more than a foot off my tail.

Central Expressway is the Highway of the Nerds. i mean, it's surrounded by all these high powered high tech companies with high powered individuals living high-powered fast-paced lifestyles. it's common knowledge that these sorts of people drive fast, sleep little, eat less and don't change their underwear because frankly, they don't have that kind of time.

it's in the air; it's contagious. no, rather, it's epidemic. and so while i'm being passed by silicon valley zombies i can't help but realize how uncomfortable i feel. or maybe out of place.

these people love to go fast but really go nowhere.  kinda like a hamster on a greased wheel.
