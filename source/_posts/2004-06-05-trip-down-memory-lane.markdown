Episode One: **Great Moments in Wussyhood**
when i was little i used to put big priority on accomplishing things or whatnot. saturdays would always be the days when i had club basketball practice, and that would be my big goal for the day. so i remember one saturday in fifth grade i missed practice cuz i overslept or something.. and i was so upset i sat down on the couch and cried. what the heck?!

i could never talk to girls. like i would sit across from this one girl, let's call her wendy, and for ALL OF FIFTH GRADE i would want to talk to her just once. seemed like i had all the golden pickup lines (i didn't) or the perfect wisecrack (didn't, either) that would be sure to put a smile on her face, but the words could never make it out of my mouth. and so that's how it went pretty much for the whole year till one day she dropped her eraser and i bent down to pick it up and she smiled and looked me in the eye and said "why thank you". i went home woozy.

and i remember i had a friend named andy barsan. too bad he was shunned by the rest of fourth grade society, and i remember i had invited him to my 10th birthday party or so at "Scoops and Tubes" (remember that?) and we were in the tunnels and everybody was like "quick! andy's coming, let's get outta here!" and i was too wussy to stand up to them and ran away too. i felt like crud after that.

stay tuned for more episodes of "Memory Lane"!
