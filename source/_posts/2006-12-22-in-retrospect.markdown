Even though these last like eight weeks have been a nonstop train wreck of deadlines, I feel oddly good. Balanced--I've had peace all throughout this semester. It's kind of weird but I've been stressing out less and simply resting a lot more. A part of it is having a solid sleep schedule (I slept 6 hours every night!). What does it mean to study & learn as an act of worship? For me, it meant dismantling the school idol and making time for G. It meant managing my time so I wouldn't have to rush things last minute. It meant respecting my limits even when I felt the assignment wasn't perfect (hence, no all-nighters baby). It meant giving up my own performance expectations. It sucks that it's taken me like six years to learn that I am created with limits, but dude. It is good. Time with G is sweet and good for my soul. And man, He's faithful. I checked my transcript today--a;oiwjgawe how did you hook it up?!?  
  
I feel older (in good ways). It's not something that I can put a finger on. Maybe if I contrasted Junior Me of this year against Wide-Eyed Me of frosh year with Slightly Angsty Me of soph year, you could see the difference. But part of it is simply gathering more responsibilities and getting to know older people. It's a new feeling, moving into a life path that is less paved. "The twenties were confusing years," the older people in my community group tell me, "the thirties are a good decade." Whoa, hang on, let me live these next 10 years first.  
  
I was blessed to have an awesome CS 162 group that was crazy brilliant, diligent and downright fun. I might actually miss these guys.  
  
Urbana's in less than a week, and I honestly don't know how to prepare for it. I read this guy's Xanga where he writes it totally blew him away and left him forever "uncomfortable with comfort" and middle-road Christianity. I don't know whether to embrace that or run from that, do you know what I mean? Jesus-following is all-or-nothing. I either wholeheartedly take up that cross, die to my dreams and hang onto what is Better or I take the safe way out (cuz faith is a ephemeral and oft-fleeting thing) and walk the easier road. And I do understand that following wholeheartedly looks different with every person according to G's plan and purpose.  
  
The question, as it has always been for me, is a question of surrender. Can I hold onto my life just a little longer? I do remember struggling with the same thing years ago in high school, thinking that I chose a path. But times change and compasses decalibrate. Now that I've built my castles up just a little more (say, after starting the degrees), it does get harder to turn the sand shovel and bucket over. God, redeem that. Help me work through this.  
  
I'm in Hawaii now, just chillin' haha. My fam's up here in Honolulu taking it easy, seeing the sights. The weather here's a good 80 degrees (I'm not missing the frigid SoBay weather at all). It's been good having time to slow down, enjoy time with the fam, process things in my head, and enjoy the beach. I'm actually kicking it in a PMT place out here across from the convention center and a little wary of walking back to the hotel (the place is sorta shady after dark actually :D)  
  
Pictures to come. Soon.
