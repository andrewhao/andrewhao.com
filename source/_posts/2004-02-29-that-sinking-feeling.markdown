do you know what I'm talking about? I mean, that feeling that when you reread your college essays once over again and you just want to shoot yourself because they are so dang CHEESY?! why didn't I catch this before? why didn't anybody tell me about this? somebody alert the Center for Disease Control, because this is pretty bad.

this next week is going to be pretty darned busy with the musical gearing up into production. on a related thought, go see it everybody! on a related thought, I hope I don't die this week.

there was something going on in today's worship service. I can't put my finger on it; during the last set of songs I felt smothered.. like my ability to worship was being drained. it's not something I can entirely say or explain here, but all I know is that the spiritual realm is real.. sometimes in scary ways. somebody please pray for me.

i hated how caught up in my looks i was getting, so I made sure to give myself a bad haircut on saturday. and the goatee, i'm definitely gonna keep that. the ultimate girl repellent  8O  8)
