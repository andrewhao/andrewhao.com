crunch time this week. seems like everything i've planned and put off is pretty much converging right now. and that equals one pretty sleepless, stressed out andrew.

God.. you're my resting place. remind me of that.

on a slightly humorous note, i called LifeTouch photos today to find that my senior portrait time is scheduled tomorrow. hey, couldn't you guys let me know a little earlier?? i figure it's all good.. i'll show up half asleep with bedhead and the **works**. ah what's the big deal.. it's just a photo! i don't care if my kids laugh at my picture.. which they probably will.. dot dot dot

okay i might care a little bit. but no reason to stress over too much about. yeup. now watch as i spring a pimple overnight the size of west africa on my forehead.

what may be worse than the west african pimple is trying to read through _why americans hate politics_ and stay awake and alive at the same time. suddenly cleaning my room seems like a very attractive option.

oh yeah, welcome to **www.g9labs.com**! there's not much new content up yet, but i hope this site turns out to hold some pretty darn cool stuff. we'll see about that.

until the cornflakes get soggy,
