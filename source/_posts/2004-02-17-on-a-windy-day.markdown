add this to the list of "things that make you love life": windy days.

i woke up today listening to gusts of wind blow past the house (and wondering just for a moment whether it was going to blow down) and feeling.. what's the word i'm looking for? i'm not quite sure, but i needed to open the window and watch the trees get tossed around, feel the storm and savor the feeling.

that's so corny. i dont have the right words to describe it, but that's all right.
