we're remodeling this week ??? please pardon the dust.


//edit
read the sunday mercury news: "ambush of echo company." it documents a company of troops in Iraq as they go through a fatal ambush. i guess it's really easy to write off the Iraq war as being remote and of no direct effect on us, but after reading this article my heart really went out. why die at 18? or when you're a newlywed with so much to look forward to? how many loved ones are you supposed to leave grieving? i'm kicking myself for being so naive up till now.

//edit2
so i had a conversation with an old school friend the other day about another of our mutual friends (that i haven't seen in awhile). the conversation went like this.

me: yeahh, __________, i remember him! we go way back.
him: ohh you mean Pothead ______ ?
me:  :idea:  :idea:  :idea:  i guess? back when i knew him he was a wholesome kinda guy
him: well, not anymore.

again, that's my naivete coming into play. i don't know, i don't like to categorize people based on what they've done or the mistakes they've made. it seems like we're totally discrediting who they really are as a person and lumping them into the "loser" or "druggie" or "flirt" or whatever category without even considering who they really are. not to be preaching, but i've got good friends who make bad mistakes. their mistakes (and some of them are pretty bad) don't automatically give me reason to leave them behind.

well, i haven't seen _____ in awhile so i'm not one to judge. but when i do see him, i'd like to give him a second chance. methinks this is still a bit on the naive side, but i dont think it could hurt.
