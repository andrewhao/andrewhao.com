OKAY so the polls have closed on this month's topic and the general consensus seems to be "in the end, most girls like the good guys" and also "what kind of chair is a toadstool, anyways?" stay tuned for next month's unqualified romantic poll topic  8O

so i'm in a slightly drugged out state (Red Bull, it seems, gives you more than just wings but a caffeine overdose complex) a couple of hours before my APCS test, and it occurred to me that I haven't run through a practice test, used my $20-odd review book for anything more than a paperweight, and that because my mother has a very motherly habit of draping a sleeping bag over my body wherever I happen to randomly conk out.

for example, last night it was the couch in the midst of bio studying, the previous nights before i have been (sprawled) right next to my desk on the hardwood floor. on both occasions i was supposed to be studying for something big, but dagnabit, my mother is **too DARN MOTHERLY**. what i really needed from her was a booming "WAKE UP, YOU NEED TO STUDY" and a couple of swift kicks to the butt. seriously.

but nope, my mother just brings the sleeping bag over and drapes it over me and probably whispers a couple of things to herself "aww he's studying so hard". i wish she wouldn't, because what i really need is consciousness so i can actually, you know, study instead of sleeping snugly inside a ratty Costco sleeping bag.

rats. but hey mom, thanks for everything, that's why i love ya.
