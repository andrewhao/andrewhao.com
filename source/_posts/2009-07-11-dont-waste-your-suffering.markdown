I've been thinking a lot about how hard life is.

It's been a rough month for everyone. Folks suffering through cancer, layoffs, relationship losses, and passings in the family. Stories of confusion, backstabbing, heartbreak, and confusion are bubbling up right and left. What do we do in this despair?

The wife of my old pastor was recently diagnosed with Stage IV lymphoma. It crept up on her, silently and suddenly. Reading emails my pastor sent, I was struck by how raw the feelings of fear, loss, and pain were.

But far over it all was a tone of resilience. "We've called this theme of this season of our lives 'Don't waste your cancer'" I hear how determined they are to face this silent killer with faith and continue running this race with endurance.

This has been a bit of a rough patch for myself as well. I'm not quite sure how to describe it.

Yesterday at small group we were talking about Jesus and his suffering on earth and on the cross. How in the end, we can endure great suffering because we hope in the eternal (the things unseen) and, powerful and reassuring to me, that Jesus himself endured our suffering. He knows exactly what it's like.

Don't waste your cancer. What's it like to hope instead of being paralyzed by fear?

Don't waste your suffering. What's it like to look beyond ourselves to others and Jesus instead of descending into a pit of despair?

I want to know this. To hope, to rejoice, to continue on the Mission. We may not know it now, but we know it nonetheless.
