um.. homework progress? i wont say much about that save the fact that i wont be sleeping much.

what happened to break? what happened to those "break resolutions" i made? and why have i violated (violated.. love that hahaha) nearly all of em? you're horrible andrew..

my parents went out to dinner tonight.. it's their 21st anniversary. wow.. 21 years. that's longer than i've been alive by 5 years. one thing i admire about my parents is how they still love each other even after so long. seems to me that relationships these days are so.. temporary. off and on. so casual. they say that with every relationship you break up in, you lose a little piece of yourself. even that these days doesnt seem so important. you hear about this couple at school.. madly in love and then in two months.. they've broken up again. and either one party is totally heartbroken - or s/he acts like nothing has happened. like they took it for granted. like breaking up was an expected thing to happen.

one heart in shreds.. another heart that is too callous to be shredded to begin with. that's sad.

what happened to the concept of true love? the waiting for the one would be best for you? since when did social pressure dictate how you felt for another person? what you thought was right.. what felt right.. what seemed right..

..really wasn't?
