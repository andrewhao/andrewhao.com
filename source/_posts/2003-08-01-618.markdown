i need to get back into my blog-posting habits more often otherwise i'm gonna lose these thoughts. goodness.. ever since my site died i've lost the urge to update. i'm happy to say though that the ProfilePlus will come back to life soon.. along with the **envzn** blog now to be hosted on **g9labs.com** woohoo! keep your eyes peeled in the next few weeks..




we've been busy these past few weeks planning for youth group activities that are going to come up in the next two weeks.. **praise night** on friday, **java night** on saturday (please come! free food, free coffee, free PMT, and lots of people you can laugh at! (namely me)) we've also got the **senior sendoff** coming up next friday.. i honestly can say that it will rock your socks and sock your rocks and all that good stuff.. you seniors shall have a proper farewell (all 30 of you @_@). then right up after that is a top secret project that we are sworn to secrecy about..




so yeah.. altogether its gonna be a lot of fun but man.. it's not easy. being a leader definitely has its drawbacks and responsibilities and i can honestly say that we're feeling it. i think i've really asked for it personally cuz i cant find a way to say "no" sometimes.. so i'll take on project after another project and soon enough i'm trapped.




you know how sometimes you start on a project then get so into it that you've forgotten what the project was about in the first place? (yeah my fourth grade science fair project was like that) i think that sometimes we get so caught up in the details when we plan and everything that we forget why we did it in the first place.. what the focus was, who we're putting the event on for. so yeah.. that's something i'm trying to watch out for.




coming back from mexico hit me pretty hard. mostly because there i saw how **real fellowship** in the spirit was.. then i came back to reality at home and realized.. wow.. we're far from perfect. especially in my youth group.. i came back and saw how Satan was really pulling us apart. i saw how people came in and didnt feel loved. i saw how hypocritical we really were. i saw rifts between people form and hearts harden. i could see the spread of apathy on us and i wasnt exempt from any of it either. don't get me wrong.. i know that every youth group goes through these same struggles, and i know that God has especially blessed CIA with so many awesome people. i'm making this sound like a tragedy when honestly we should be doing victory dances.




but it's really been weighing on my heart ever since i got back. you see.. we've got a long way to go. we're doing great, but we can be doing **more**. there's so much more real fellowship and passion and love to be unleashed.. there's so much more in store for us! God **wake us up**, make us restless.. never keep us satisfied with what we have. that's my prayer.




i don't feel as if i've said everything on my heart, but maybe now's not the time. till then, it's time for some mexico pictures!:

this is thomas, my very mature youth pastor doing his raptor impression. by the look of absolute horror on the other guy's face, i'd say its pretty realistic (he's screaming like a schoolgirl)
