ugh.. i had so much free time today at my disposal and i wasted it all.. sleeping, eating, daydreaming and being online.

i wish for one day i could just.. do straight work.. and i'd feel so good about myself afterwards. but you know what.. i dont think that's possible with me =P

my computer's dying on me.. it gets overloaded and then it starts popping up error messages right and left, AIM logs me on/off randomly and other things like that. great.

i'm thinking of trying out for clarinet section leader in marching band next year, but i dont think i have enough playing skill. i mean, i got the marching part down.. i think. but i guess i'm kinda worried because i'm not exactly a kennie g or anything. i dont take lessons (dont have time) and i dont practice very often (same excuse). sigh.. i guess i'd need to start sometime and now would be a good time =)

gonna get my butt into gear now. homework is cool.
