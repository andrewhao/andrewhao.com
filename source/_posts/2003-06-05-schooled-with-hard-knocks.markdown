what a year.. i'm learning a lot of things about myself that i'd never intended to learn. case-in-point #1: failure..

when people are counting on you and you don't do your part to pull through.. you've got nobody to blame but yourself. failure is, to put it succinctly, your fault. and i don't know if it's just me.. but i seem to beat myself up over my own shortcomings cuz they're often so stupid.

and failure it was today.. i'm sorry yishu. that was total lack of effort on my part.. i made some stupid mistakes that should never have happened. i take full responsibility for what happened and i hope your grade won't suffer for it  :?  gah i'm really sorry.. i feel so bad..  :red:

responsibility isn't rocket science. it's so simple but why's it seem to be out of my reach? i've been learning my limitations a lot lately and they've been tearing away at my ego.

thanks God. i needed that.

senior finals this week and i am SPENT. seems as if that linkin park song fits right here: "tried so hard and got so far - in the ennnd it doesnt even matterr"

yeah.. especially with spanish. spent hours and hours studying for that test only to have it blow up in my face during 7per. what a day.

but then i crank up AA and headbang - "**i get down.. you lift me uuupp..**"
