for a moment today i thought i found you, the girl i knew two years ago.

hi, it's me, Andrew. nice to meet you. i've been sitting next to you in class all year.

every day i see you demurely pull out your pocket mirror and application kit and paint your eyelids (i'm sure there's a more graceful term for that, but i wouldn't know) thick and heavy; maybe a blueberry-ish shade that ends up looking a little black.

but two years ago you scared me a little with blueberry Maybelline mascara and flirty clothes - maybe a boy came into your life or you felt you didn't have the looks of your chattery friends or you grew unsatisfied after one too many issues of _Seventeen_; i suspect it's a combination of all three. but your looks and your demeanor and your attitude - those all seemed to change.

today i thought i saw a glimpse of who you were before, it was with a little smile and a chuckle. and maybe i was wrong all along.

i don't think we'd mind if you came to school, just once, without the make-up and with some comfortable scrubby clothes. you were like that once, i saw it today. and hey, who knows, maybe you're a little tired of the facade.

when people are secure in who they are inside and let it show, i think that's reason for celebration. there's something sweet about that in a girl that's genuine.

so hey you, girl-next-to-me, find more reasons to lighten up and find more reasons to smile. that beats blueberry mascara any day.
