welcome back to reality, Mr. Hao.

i've had almost **nothing** to do over this weekend in terms of homework or other responsibilities.. so why did i feel so busy? i think i bring these things on myself.

my parents were talking about how when they were all teens, they never had anything to do (well besides from studying). i dont know if that's a good thing or not. i kind of envy that.. being able to just have no stress.. no computers... not (too) much responsibility hanging on you.

but that's not how it is, and i've gotta come down to reality starting tonight.

on the plus side, i've slept for over 12 hours today. and i've got no homework to do.

on the minus side, i've got a lot of forms to go through for various things.. aye those are a headache. lots of other various club things to figure out. i'm trying not to stress. really.

devos.. gonna go do em now. then it's some form-filling. SAT2 IIC to study for and some phone calls to make. happy thoughts, Mr. Hao. happy thoughts.
