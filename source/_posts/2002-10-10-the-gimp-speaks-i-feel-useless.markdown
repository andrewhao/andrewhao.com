agh.. so here i sit at the computer at 4PM in the afternoon while my cross country team is off running their 5 mile fartleks. me? i'm just a gimp with shin splints. i know it sounds crazy but.. despite all the pain associated with fartleks.. I WANNA RUN. man.. i hate the thought of sitting on my butt getting slower every day. i hate having to sit and wait and recover. i know i should spare my body (and i'm limping around right now) but MAN my competitive side tells me to get out there and get workinnnnng. ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the surefire symptoms of running addiction.

last night was really really weird. i slept from about 8PM to 12AM.. then pretty much stayed awake (with minor dozes of unconsciousness here and there). the weird thing is that at about 4AM, your body doesnt feel tired anymore and you feel fine. but then you get to school and you pass out. yep.

chem screwedness.. i totally forgot to do my prelab on our previous lab report and that is singlehandedly responsible for sending my grade down the tubes (who knew it'd be worth so much?). and on the topic of some more chem fun.. i'm responsible for jacking up my chem partner (scott lin) and my titration lab.. er apparently our solution is very funky.. definitely not right.

i said i wouldn't get infatuated again. but with the same person? how can i see through my feelings?

sigh.. sitting at home now really gives me a guilt trip. i should start studying for SATs now? hahaha.. how sad. i think i'll go do that.
