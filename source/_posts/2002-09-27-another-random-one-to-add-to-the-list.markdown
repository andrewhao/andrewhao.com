yes yes.. i havent really had the time to get my thoughts down for these past few weeks. and i really don't have too much time left tonight either. but i digress.

got to school LATE today.. aiyah. you see last night i was doing one of my funky sleep things where i plan to nap for 15 minutes and it ends up going for about.. 5 hours. anyways i woke up at 3AM in a **panic** and ended up working till daybreak. yeah.. it wasnt really good for me because when i got back in bed to sleep for all of 30 minutes, i ended up sleeping for an hour.

and what made it worse was when my mom overslept too. yeah.. she's usually the person that gets me up every morning (she's the REAL alarm clock). so when she oversleeps - i'm in real trouble too. and so i sure was in trouble today.

late to school needless to say by about 15 minutes. kinda slinked into class and promptly fell asleep. man.. no good.

agape meeting on tuesday was pretty cool. robert koo and i were in charge of making up games so we had quite a few planned for the lunch period. only problem was that the lunch period uh.. isnt all that long. haha but we had fun anyways. we had a problem with our posters saying that the 1st meeting was on the 26th when our first meeting was the 24th.. hhahah but it was cool. we had a lot of people show up today for the prayer meeting too.

itd be awesome to see what agape could become. a place where people really can feel comfortable being themselves and sharing about their personal walks with God. and not only that but a place where people MEET God.. every meeting. that's our goal. not just some boring thing where people just sit around and talk and sing and stuff. a totally charged experience with God.. every meeting. can you imagine that?

i'm pretty happy now.. i finished my chunky chem packet with minimal moments of insanity and sheer panic. and calc too. calc was nice today. yes.

tomorrow's gonna be pretty busy. XC pictures after school and we also get our sweatshirts and t-shirts! whoo i'm pretty excited.. but also a little worried about the t-shirts. i'm kinda wishing i had a little more freedom with the color scheme so i could pick some more.. attractive colors haha. we'll see..

clarinet sectionals till 5.. then off to do an alt creek run workout and then off to Hank's pasta feed at 6 till its time to leave for CIA. yeah.. it should be fun. i hope?
