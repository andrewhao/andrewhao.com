well i guess i gotta thank those of you that remembered my birthday - because i nearly forgot =D

seriously. i'd nearly forgotten all about it. sunday morning i woke up and i was thinking _"well if today's the twenty-sixth, then tomorrow's the twenty-seventh and... hey.. isnt that my birthday??"_

wow.. seventeen. seems like just yesterday i was 11 years old with a big birthday bash at Scoops and Tubes (formerly Kids Play, now a "Comics and Cards" in the Bollinger Plaza) where we all crawled frantically through those suspended tube mazes and consumed massive amounts of pizza till we just sat down and fell asleep.

365 more days and i'm a legal adult. that blows my mind. adult? A-D-U-L-T? that's for.. grownups. **and i'm not grown up yet!! **wow guys.. we're starting to leave our childhoods behind. what a scary thought.

but yeah.. thanks to all of the presents.. the "it's a boy!" balloon ("hey is it your birthday?" "naw i just adopted a kid" =D).. cards and the birthday wishes. it's always nice to know that somebody cares.

thanks. you guys made my day.
