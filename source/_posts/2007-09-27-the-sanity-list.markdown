Whenever life gets _crazy_ and I feel wont to complain, I draft a list of things I'm really thankful for. Some things keeping me sane this week:



	
  1. Smiles, laughter and witty repartee.

	
  2. Shamelessly printing on 24lb paper (none of that cheap 20lb stuff!)--in color!

	
  3. Boatloads of free pens at the career fair (and that sweet Firefox t-shirt that made it all worth it).

	
  4. A fleeting memory of a feeling (or a feeling of a memory) of how Jesus is _worth it_. I'm getting back to that place.

	
  5. Hardwood basketball courts.
