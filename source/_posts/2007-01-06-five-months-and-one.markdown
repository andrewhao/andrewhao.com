"There is this image I have of me bowing down before you, it is dark, I am beside a campfire. And I'm sliding across to you my armor: my achievements, my abilities, my ego, my vanity. The armor scrapes against the dirt and I lay prostrate, exposed, hum(ble)iliated. Such is the position of a servant."
