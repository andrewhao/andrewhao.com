"Come Yilmaz, up yourself and let's go."

His companion's voice tugged at him from beyond the ether, and as such he slogged to break through his mind's haze and drag an eyelid open. Days of travel through the treacherous Kaçkars had worn them through, and his companion's ragged appearance was suddenly new to him again, like a dog or a beggar. Yilmaz tried to stifle a laugh (unsuccessfully) to the chagrin of his companion.

To his knees he half-rolled, half-crawled, his bones murmuring their complaints. He remembered the first time he had realized he was old: his son Asil had knocked him over in a playful attempt to wrestle him to the ground. Yilmaz had his back turned, and hadn't been prepared for the full onslaught of the 12-year old. With the breath knocked halfway out of his lungs, he was surprised at the sinewy strength in his son's arms. Though wiry, the boy possessed a strength of a man whose life work was in his hands. He had already begun to talk about going into town to go to secondary school, an idea Yilmaz had resisted at first without knowing why.

Ayla had reassured him that the boy was dreaming the right things; his wife was usually right. School would be right for Asil, who needed to be among children his age. She rarely made much of a fuss about anything, but her insistence about Asil's schooling had caught him off-guard. They had danced around the subject for days, but her reasoning, motherly wisdom and effervescent charm began to win him over.

She held him in the years he lay in confinement. He'd often awaken to the sensation of tendrils of warmth, fast-fading, brushed against his back and chest. Under the evergreen canopy he walks to her where she takes his weathered hands in hers. Lightly kissing her forehead, he inhales the dewy fragrance of her hair long enough to steal it away for the morning ahead. She continues to anchor Asil firmly to the earth with slender, wise hands.

A thunderclap of pain pushed Yilmaz to his knees, and with a horse's determination and much moaning, he straightened up. The setting sun glimmered off the distant outline of the Black Sea with the day's last portion of light. The guards and their search dogs would never find them here.

When Yilmaz lay in his cell, he'd often dream of a moment such as this: the torches would be blazing long after dark, welcoming him home. He'd round the corner to be greeted by the cries of his boy and the warmth of his beloved and the scent of evergreens. The door would be open, stuck in the gravel, and upon entering his home he would be received with the laughter of friends, the sighs of relief, and an overwhelming desire to crumple to the floor and bawl and kick and moan.
