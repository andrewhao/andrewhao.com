Sunshine. Thanks!

------------------------
So this past weekend I was at UCLA sweatin' code with the FAQQLY boys and girls. We're launching (this week) faster than you can say, "Jibba-jabba". I met some awesome folks who know awesome folks that know me (awesome by extension).

I got this feeling yesterday after the launch party, that God's been orchestrating a specific confluence of events that has led me to where I am today, with specific talents, knowing certain people, going through the past semester of.. trials and a lot of pain. Specifically, to bring me here and I can't help but be in awe.

Jibba-jabba!

Here's a pic of some of the team with Keiko Agena (she's holding the mug) in the middle. You may know Keiko as Lane Kim on the Gilmore Girls. Rock on. (Patrick and I are coding in the background trying not to appear overly interested.)

girls and talking and talking to girls intimidates me still.
