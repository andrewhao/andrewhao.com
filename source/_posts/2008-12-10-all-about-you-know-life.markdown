There are big changes on the horizon. I feel like I could expand on each of these, but I'll just bullet point them for now. They may be entries in their own right in the future...



	
  * Now that Annie, Esther and I have all graduated, my parents have moved to Shanghai (my dad's found a new job there). So it's a big change for our family, and I've been grappling with the changes that come with it. Among the themes: the loss of home, the power of parents' love, growing up and... yardwork.

	
  * I'm graduating in December, and am watching my college career draw to a close. With it comes the inevitability of shifting relationships and a different lifestyle that I can no longer deny or dodge.

	
  * I'll take a month off in January to relax at home, then in February, Sarah and I are taking a missions trip to Botswana to visit her old missions agency. It's a place that's held a huge place in her heart for a long time, and I'm going with my eyes, ears and heart open to see what Africa's all about. More on this soon--I can't wait!

	
  * That wild and wacky ride known as recruiting has drawn to a close, and I'm entering the working world! I interviewed widely, and was blessed with two job offers (in an economy like this one, having an offer is a blessing in itself). I had to take a good long look at myself and ask: what are my passions? What am I great at? Where do I want to live, what kind of work environment do I want to have, and how easy is it to make relationships? How much do salary and perks actually mean to me?In the end, I had to make a decision between a position at [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com) and a position at [Riverbed](http://www.riverbed.com). It was a tough decision that came down to the wire, but in the end I chose to join Riverbed. I'll be working as a UI designer; my team will design management interfaces on Riverbed's family of network appliances.

I was attracted to Riverbed's friendly engineering culture and felt that I had the greatest opportunity there to develop and exercise creative design skills. I'll start in March, which leads me to...

	
  * I'm in the process of searching for an apartment in San Francisco (or Berkeley). My buddy Jack and I are planning on living together, and we're looking for a third roommate. If you're interested... let me know!
