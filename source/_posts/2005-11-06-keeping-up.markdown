I apologize for the space between meaningful posts. Life's been hectic, fast and definitely unboring. Antiboring. Nonboring. Not boring. Whatever.

God's been blowing my mind with new revelations, convictions, connections, relationships, and all that good (and ugly) stuff. I unfortunately don't have the time nor the space to write it up here, but do give me a call if you'd like to find out.

That's right, hit me up baby. Jeremy Lee (if you read this), do not hold back.
