wow.. this christmas season has been so full of blessings. i dont know how to describe it.

my mom and dad have been so cool.. they've always been so supportive, so generous and haha i dunno.. they show so much love. its crazy.. i know that the family i live in is really rare these days  :question: making me all the more thankful for them.

but ya.. life's been good recently. maybe too good, i think i'm in need of a jolt of reality sometime hahaha. my college apps are (pretty much) finished, it's winter break, i've been eating great food and enjoying friends and family.. it's awesome.

so thanks God.. you've blessed me beyond what i can imagine.

lately i've been forgetting that though.. thinking what i've gained and achieved is my own. and i've gotta keep kicking myself mentally and telling myself "you're not your own, so quit acting like it!" i think the most dangerous time in your spiritual life is when you think you've got control of it all and begin to get lazy and lose that dependence. i'm trying hard to keep depending, but it's a struggle.

on a totally separate note, how long has it been since i've actually initiated an IM conversation? how sad  :!:

merry christmas and a happy holidays
