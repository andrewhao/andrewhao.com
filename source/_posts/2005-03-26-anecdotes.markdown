My body's been Miserable this week. Enough to warrant the capital M. Worth it, though.

Last weekend I had the IV frosh over at my house. Hilarity ensued. Every single one of these photos were [blatantly stolen](http://photos.yahoo.com/plusonederful).

aw shucks.

**The Rest of the Week**
Is summed as such:

Hang out at pearl milk tea shops.
Get progressively sicker.
Attempt to code (fail miserably).
Sleep very little.
Troubleshoot every single computer for every single one of my relatives.
Help out at my old youth group.
See old (and new) faces.

WELL WORTH IT, YUP.

I'm going to write an entry about my lessons learned from Berkeley (ha) and how I've grown and been challenged and pushed and how much I love it there. Then I'm going to make every freakin' high school senior who tells me "I don't wanna go to Berkeley because ________" read it.
