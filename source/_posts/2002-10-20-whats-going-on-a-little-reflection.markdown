well.. yesterday was kind of interesting. took the PSATs at lynbrook (they were all right i guess). didnt study at all.. but i survived (i mean who's gonna get a scholarship anyways?) hehe..

band went to fresno state for a pretty big comp there. man.. their stadium has a NICE sound to it. yeah.. too bad our show pretty much sucked that day. blah. it's mostly cuz of some individuals cant.. march... ergh.. must.. control.. self... keep telling myself to have faith in the future.. but man. it's so frustrating sometimes! i dont know.. it was slightly humiliating losing by that much to the other bands in our division. what are we doing wrong? i just dont get it. i sort of feel like i've failed in my duty as section leader. i mean.. i havent transformed my section into the marchers that we need them to be. i need lots of patience there. lots. :(

but anyways.. it was a fun experience overall. buses got back about 2:45ish and i had to do the duty of taxi driver and so got home pretty late.. about 3ish. ate a really really late snack and was in bed by 4.

..which meant i was wiped out today. after the care ministry meeting after church i just crashed in bed till 6PM. i was kinda mad at myself cuz i feel like i gotta finish hw before i sleep. but i cant help it.. and i guess my body needs it.

i keep talking about sleep. one of these days i'm gonna just quit whining  :)
