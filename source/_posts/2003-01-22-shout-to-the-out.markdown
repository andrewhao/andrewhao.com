you know i was just thinking today.. and i came to the totally obvious but always valid point that the reason that i got to become the person i am today is due to the people i've come in contact with. i just wanted to thank those who've made a difference in my life - those who've pushed me to the next level in terms of my spiritual life, you guys who make me laugh out loud and make an absolute foolio of myself in class (the memories that make me chuckle even now). to the guys where no words need to be said between us, my parents and their continual support and understanding... my classmates for keeping me motivated. those of you who've always stood with** support **and **encouragement **and to those who **believed in me**:

ya'll awesome now, you hear? i am who i am because of you guys.
thank you.
