it's 4AM and i've just woken up. these funky sleep habits are getting normal for me, and i dont expect to sleep again today. and someday, this will kill me.

yesterday i got up at 7:30AM to head over to church for worship practice. wow.. andrew yip got his taylor - really really nice stuff! haha so anyways this was my first time ever on the e-drums and i guess it turned out all right (my philosophy: hit enough drums at enough times and it's all good  :) ) definitely a different feeling though.

speaker was tim leung from.. i don't know. i remember this guy from years back.. mostly cuz of his bad bruce lee jokes  :)  but yeah.. he's an awesome speaker and you can tell he's got a passion for God and for sharing his message. good stuff.

got a haircut today - the hairstylist looked pretty distracted and i don't think she was fully concentrating on the whole hair-cutting thing so i think she cut a little too much :(  but it's all good (iag).. it'll grow back. faster, i hope.

went to fry's for no particular reason at all. got a vantec stealth case fan for the computer cuz my old one made it sound like a helicopter and seriously killed my ears. so quiet now ahh.. and 20oz drinks are only 79 cents! so cheap! whoo!

the rain and wind outside are really picking up. pretty creepy, but that just makes me even more glad for a house, insulated walls and a central heater =P

okay, i'm really gonna start work now. ttyl.
