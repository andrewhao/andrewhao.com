oh man.. i thought this week would NEVER end. phew.. its been a really big roller coaster ride (in only 5 days too). went through way too much..

but i'm still alive. and i'm feeling a little better.

yeah.. i was at CIA tonight and it really lifted my spirits again. yeah.. when you're around your Christ family and worshipping and everything.. hanging out afterwards.. thats just totally awesome. man.. if it werent for God and my friends at church.. i'd really burn out.

but yeah.. im feeling decently happy again. gotta get some of my projects done ahead of time now haha..
