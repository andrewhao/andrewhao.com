well today was the last day of "real" class (i'm posting right now from the Foothill media lab). i think i'm becoming certifiably lazy.. that is.. i'm getting normal again. last night was thinking about doing my homework..

nah.

i think i've stopped caring for the A now.. i've given up on it. with the way my past tests have gone.. its going to take a miracle to maintain an A. and with the way my past tests have gone.. that miracle won't be happening.

i mean sure.. i could obviously do it with a superhuman amounts of studying and preparation. but seriously. would you want to bust your butt for a summer class? aw come on.. i'm just a junior. let my real "hard work" begin in september.

if i dont pull myself together then, i'm in a world of trouble.
