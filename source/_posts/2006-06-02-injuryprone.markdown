So I fell off my longboard and twisted my ankle maybe two months ago. And it got insanely crazy better the first night... but the rest of the healing process kind of stopped there.

That was two [?] months ago, and my ankle still hasn't healed right. And I can't run like I usually do. And my bike tires are underinflated and I haven't gotten around to buying a pump. So since I've been home, I've been active maybe a total of zero times. And intake is definitely exceeding output. Yeah, I hate whiners, especially hypocritical ones.

Mom, why is your food so good. Cursesssss...

**I love thrift store shopping.** It's those gems you find once in awhile that make it worthwhile. It's the built-in dealfinder [read: cheap (I get this from my dad)] that is in my DNA.

**Tried to go exploring** today up Highway 9 (Big Basin) but alas, my fears of wasting fuel conquered my desire to see what's on the other side of the highway. It's a wonderful feeling though, driving with the windows down, music up, and the forest around you. Too bad it costs you an arm and a leg these days.

I got tailed by like four or five fast drivers. Say it's you being tailed. You're new to the area, you're driving a curvy two-lane highway. What do you do?
