It comes like a beautiful blow to the head, a thunderous, laughterous catharsis. It's a hammer-blow to your rose-colored world; you fall with it and you laugh as you pick up pieces. The laughter controls you, it is from you but not of you.

So it is, you learn to love the shards; they're more beautiful that way. They are evidence of entropy: the universe growing more random, less ordered, less perfect with every second.

Laughing through tears is much harder than it sounds. Your tear ducts say one thing while your heart throbs with errors, blunders; they speak wonderful stories of toes you have stepped on, misunderstandings, dealings with ones you love, games (against) fate and chance. They are Life's little entropic surprises.

Hey little boy, why are you crying? Don't you know, what once was is no longer and He loves you and your broken jars, ambitions, desires, failures. You are beautiful, you are my beloved one. I adore you, I love you. Do you understand [1+1=2] that?

It makes sense.

_I'm realizing how little of my life can be controlled by myself, but how hard (!) I fight against that fact._

_I have a lot of pathetic ways I use to hold onto vestiges of my old (more-perfect) self (I like to think that sometimes). I sacrificed my health and sleep for these past three weeks to survive paper/project/pset/midterm season. I listened and prayed for and served people. I didn't complain, God. I DID WHAT I COULD. I DID GOOD STUFF. I DESERVE SO MUCH. And it doesn't work out, like 1+1=2 should, and I'm just left to laugh at myself and the absurdity of my treadmill self???a hard thing to do._

_I feel dumb saying this, but I wrote this after meeting Marshawn Lynch tonight in Unit 3. Or rather, walking past him and a group of his friends and blowing him off (inadvertently) as he called out to get me to take a picture of his group. Justin Hong got the camera, and I turned around and realized who he was, my jaw dropped ten inches._

_And I was torn apart walking away from that encounter (after receiving a good-natured ribbing from his crew), first of all because that was an Awkward-Superstar-Fan moment, secondly because it was a bad deal for the whole racial-reconciliation thing. But more than everything else, I was so rocked because I had offended him without meaning to, but he would never know that. To him, I'd just be another guy who Doesn't Care About Black People (quoting Kanye). I was to blame, and I couldn't help but replaying it in my mind at a million miles an hour, replaying it from every angle, half-laughing and half-torn-up about it all the way back home._

_I'm still laughing, and I still don't know what to do. In so many ways, this encounter sums up this awkward and unpredictable season of my life. One moment I'm feeling solid as ever, the next I'm reeling with insecurities. I don't want to end this post with neat and tidy answers. I want it to end with uneasy feelings and an open invitation to something or Someone to come._

_One love,
Andrew_
