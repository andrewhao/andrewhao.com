so it's christmas day.. and i think i'd be hard pressed to find myself any better off =D the hao household seems to be in pretty festive spirits.. my dad being his normal goofy self, mom selflessly serving christmas breakfast and my sisters talking about..something. this year feels so different from the past years (nevermind the fact that we've been out of town these last four years or so  :) ) but hey. it's christmas day, and i hope you guys are all having an awesome time too =D

spent all of yesterday trying to figure out my sister's computer and how come it wouldnt cooperate.. but in the end we got it up and running =D

going to spend a nice day today with the family.. then working on a possible new DJ Pl0w remix.. shh it's under wraps for now =D
