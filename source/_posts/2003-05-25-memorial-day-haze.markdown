just gotten back from a 3 day retreat with the leadership from my CIA yg.. its so refreshing to see that God's raising up a new generation within our group.. young leaders excited about this. yeah.. i'm really glad we identified a lot of problems that we've been having at yg.. its so good getting that off of my back and having other people share the same feelings. we need to change our ways of doing things cuz they've been so empty by themselves. it's time to stop wasting our time on the surface and actually dig deeper when we fellowship with one another.

its time to start some changes and i'm eager to see what happens. awesome stuff.

oh man.. i'm so stuffed. that was some of the greatest eating i've done in awhile.. i've probably gained about five pounds from three days (i'm serious!).. but gahhh the food was hecka nice :D

the rest of today and memorial day tomorrow will be spent video editing and panicking for various projects in various classes. whee! goodbye.
