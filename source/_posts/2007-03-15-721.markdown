I always find it good to have perspective. Especially here at Cal, where this microcosm of the world's overachieving go-getters can easily drive you nuts.  
  
Things I am thankful for:  
  
Happenstance conversations with old friends.  
Warm weather, cloudless skies and sunshine.  
GSI's that actually care about helping you learn.  
Guitar strings.  
A CS prof that dresses in cool costumes.  
Runner's high.  
The blessing it is to study in the EECS department here. Heck, the blessing to even study at Cal.  
Exchanging smiles with a pretty girl on the way to class.  
You know, that whole thing about Jesus.  
Heart-realizing God freaking adores each one of us.  
Reading the newspaper you picked up from the bin in the RSF.  
Failures: academic and physical and spiritual + all-encompassing Grace.  
Labmates for CS150 that stick around to talk you through your project.  
Late-night IM convos.  
My little sister adding me on Facebook.  
People that just drop on over unannounced.  
Dropping over at peoples' places unannounced.  
Junior class ladies and BAN.  
Friday morning basketball.  
Jam sessions.  
A really sweet apartment.  
The way Mom cheerfully answers the phone whenever I call.  
Accountability w/ Jer.  
Arizona iced tea.  
  
:D

GOOD NEWS FROM ROOMMATE!
