whoops.. why were you not supposed to microwave styrofoam again? oh well.. i got lazy today and  stuck a styrofoam plate in there anyways. nothing exploded, i'm happy to say but i got freaked out by all the crackling so i stopped it.

i had so much free time today.. man i'm so happy. i got home and conked out in my bed for five or six straight hours till 10. dang.. that was so nice.

but i was actually planning on practicing piano. man i havent had lessons in two or three weeks. my dad was talking about cutting down on piano lessons (maybe every other week) because i couldnt invest enough time to justify the cost of the lessons. and i dunno now. i've got the time now, it's a question of whether i wanna work hard. i'm starting to miss the piano already (can you believe that?). guess i'll play tomorrow.

it's 12 and i havent started a bit of homework. how's that for time management? anyways there's a late start tomorrow - that means i can go to morning worship! (first time i've been able to go for a lonnnnng time) hahaha i'm excited.

my dad's planning on assembling a new computer and being the nerd that i am, i'm pumped. i'm hyped. i'm ready. sorry.. it's a guy thing (drools on keyboard).

i'll post later. ggnow.
