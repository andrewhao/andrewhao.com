       He was not the type to check his side view mirrors. This worried her the first time she rode in his car, a low-riding '65 Mustang, but he just laughed it off. That was the other thing, he was the type to laugh too loud and too long at anything.

He had deftly swerved through traffic, in and out and in and out earning the righteous indignation of clipped off drivers. She gripped the armrests until her fingers turned white. Don't you think you're going a little too fast?

Don't be silly, he had retorted. I'm perfectly safe.

Perhaps that was his allure. She loved the dangerous ones, the ones promising risk and adventure. Yet he wasn't entirely one of them. He had a boyish face, strangely out of place with his towering stature and faded bomber jacket. His black hair fell softly over his eyes, eyes so strangely blue that stunned her so when they first made eye contact in the university library. It wasn't anything romantic; she had been studying for an economics midterm when he sat down at the table across from her, engrossed in a motorcycle magazine. His very first words to her, as she remembered with exact clarity, were "Do you happen to know where the restrooms are?"

Upon returning he immediately asked her to a Saturday dinner. She looked up, startled from numbers and economic theory. He _what?_ He grinned from ear to ear.

And so they had found themselves in a Denny's booth, sharing laughs over fried chicken and sweet mayonnaise coleslaw. They had sat on sticky vinyl seats that were a faded green, seats that had seen their share of soda spills and starry-eyed lovers. It's the way the hair falls on your face, he said as the meal drew to an end. She had blushed, the warmth from the diner adding to the burning hue on her cheeks. Let's go see the view, he excitedly suggested.

He drove with reckless abandon. Force of habit, he had explained to himself, willing himself to let off the gas pedal for a moment. The men in his family were known to drive fast and to be highly impulsive. He was no different from his father, who had proposed to his mother on their second date with a plastic decoder ring and an innocent smile. Forty years later, his parents were oddly still acting like teens. His father knew what love was. He didn't; at the old age of 21, he knew that he didn't know. As he sped up the mountain, dials and indicators glowing and dancing, a growing feeling expanded within him. Whatever it was, it had to be something like her.

He pulled off the road onto a lookout point. It's called La Vista Real, he said. Royal View. She had been impressed by his tidbit of Spanish. The mountains were strewn across the landscape. Look, she pointed at the peaks. Some of the mountaintops were dusted with snow, with jagged rocks sticking out like sore thumbs. The sun had nearly descended by now, shooting rays straight into their eyes and glowing a hot orange, then a cinder red, then it was a half-sun and then no more. They turned back to the car, gravel crunching under their soles. He had opened her passenger-side door, then stopped, a smile growing over his face. Will you marry me? he proposed, blue eyes, black hair, bomber jacket and all.

What? Don't be silly. Let's go home.

He had driven her home, weaving in and out of rush hour traffic, a smile permanently plastered on his face. She noticed the smile and couldn't help smile too. This boy was something else.

This love, fate had apparently decided, would continue:
Let's grab a bite to eat.
I got you this for your birthday.
Let's see the view again.
I think I love you.
And I do too.

I'm pregnant. _The phone call had nearly knocked him out of bed. Say that again? he had shouted into the receiver. _Say that again?!_ His mind reeled as he slammed the receiver. This was not supposed to happen. He was still a student. He had a life ahead of him. They weren't ready for this. No, no, not at all. This couldn't be happening. Not at all. He wanted to deny the sobbing voice on the line and suddenly awaken from this nightmarish reality.

She sat on her bed, still cradling the phone on her shoulder. Please, she sobbed, please oh please oh please. There was a growing life, an insistence inside of her. Her temples were throbbing rapidly, and she nearly imagined for a moment she could feel the child's heartbeat too. _Don't leave me!_ she cried into the dial tone. Please oh please, I thought we had something. I need you, you don't understand?

He understood. He threw a knapsack over into the passenger seat of the Mustang and sped out into the fading dusk, swerving past cars and lumbering trucks, engine screaming. The dials and knobs danced and glowed as the Mustang, groaning in protest, headed up to the one place he could find refuge.

He was not the type to check his side view mirrors, and she would have told him so. She would have let him know in her sweetest, most menacing tone. _You're going to get in an accident someday if you don't check those mirrors._

_        _So he swerved even harder, daring fate and whatever dictated his life to try him.

The Mustang nudged into the concrete divider in a brilliant flash of sparks. The front tires began sliding in a high pitched squeal, then suddenly his whole world was out of control. The last actual things he remembered were the shrill cries of horns and a sickening crunch that reverberated through his body and his 21-year-old world. He could see La Vista Real coming around the bend, the sun assaulting his eyes in a blazing bittersweet hue just like that first time, just like every time they had come. The sunlight was filtering in straight rays through the dusty air, like shutters that were about to close. He looked down and noticed he was in the air, up and up and up until he realized he had to come down.

It was a shattering thunder.
