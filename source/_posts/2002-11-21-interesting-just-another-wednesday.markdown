it's 5AM right now.. and i'm just up to turn off my computer. man all my sleeping habits are so off now.. i barely have time to do my homework. and if you know the typical lynbrook junior, it should be the other way around.

anyways this is gonna be one of the typical "my day was like this" journals.. sorry guys  :(  haha..

met up with james park and kenji cox and dan low early in the morning to see if we could discuss anything for the possibility of putting together a band. we kinda messed around for a bit.. didnt get all that much done heh. we (as always) are in search of a drummer.

aye.. where art thou, drummers? seems as if they are in short supply (or just hiding). daniel lui was also thinking of Agape putting.. something together in time for battle of the bands (a long ways off). only problem? we need a hard hitting drummer.

anyways.. went to morning praise/prayer this morning. ever since we moved out to the flagpole we've been getting less people (we used to be in the quad). but today there was a noticeably larger amount of people that showed up.. that's always encouraging.

wind ensemble was all right.. some of the seating was kind of messed, i ended up @ 4th chair which was pretty much what i'd expected. physics test was much easier than i'd thought.. took me awhile to get some of the concepts and i was panicking and everything but then the test was almost too easy - something's messed up about that. aye.. saw someone blatantly cheating and i didnt say anything about it. sigh.. i'm such a wuss.

calc was pretty boring as usual... i'm surprised i didnt fall asleep. yea go andrew! instead i managed to be tricked into thinking we had a test that day and frantically study for the first hour or so..then realize we didnt have one. yeah. smart.

first piano class in a long time.. aye i think i faked my way through a lesson and i feel so bad about it. man they cost so much $$ i gotta take advantage of it. haha yeah.. first time i've said that.

mb awards night tonight.. thanks to my awesome section for the flowers and cards and photo album.. thanks for all the time you guys spent on it. it makes this all worth it  :)

got back home, put on an away message and began reading scarlet letter.. and as usual i read on my bed.. which meant ZZZZZZs till 30-ish minutes ago.

and why am i writing this? for the sense of satisfaction, ya. okay way too much, got mucho work to get around to. catch you guys later - and thanks for reading this. means a lot.
