It was all rather embarrassing. I was on the BART yesterday riding back from SF to Berkeley, and the riders and I couldn't take our eyes off this dad and his kid with bright blonde hair (who couldn't have been more than eight) just having a ball.

It was all rather sweet; the dad would wrap the kid up in his arms (to the child's squealing chagrin) and nuzzle him in tight. "D Major, how about D Major?"

The child would struggle against his dad's arms. "G!"

"F Sharp!" replies the dad, "Okay, you're free." He releases the kid, who runs forward and promptly bonks his head into the opposite seat back. Then that kid would laugh for a good long while. "F Sharp!"  he'd cry and collide back into his dad's chest.

Dad would wrap his arms tight around his boy and they'd continue the drill. "Mixolydian!" the dad would say.

"Mixolydian!" the boy would reply and he'd be set free, charging forward knocking himself into the seat back, beset by the giggles.

"Paradiddle!" the dad would cry. "Paradiddle!"

Loud kissy noises ensued. Agh, it was too much (in a rather embarrassing, syrupy-sweet way). I couldn't take my eyes off of the sight.

May your families enjoy that same love in this holiday season. May you know the love (and the music) of our Father this Christmas time.
