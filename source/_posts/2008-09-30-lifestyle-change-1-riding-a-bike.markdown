This semester's been one of changes. Among them is my decision to bring my bike up to school and do some good ol-fashioned pedaling around Berkeley.

I brought the bike I used to ride in the seventh grade--complete with the bike rack on the bike I used to strap my clarinet into. Yeah, it's that old. The chains are squeaky and the derailleurs are unreliable at best and my brakes are on the verge of not working... but trust me when I say my bike's ridable :)

No, I'm not really trying to save the air, I'm more trying to save on gas and parking costs. And it's always nice getting a workout going wherever I need to go.

A couple of observations from personal experience ever since making the jump:



	
  * It's a hipster secret: you really do get cooler when you roll up your right pant leg. Too bad it's so much trouble.

	
  * Riding a bike in auto traffic is a terrifying experience. On your left is certain death from cars wanting to run you over. On your right are rows of cars whose drivers-side door threaten to open into your face at any moment. I will never get frustrated at another slow biker on the road again.

	
  * I love the feeling of high momentum, newly-poured smooth asphalt and an open road.

	
  * The campus no-bike zones have really, really changed my commute patterns.

	
  * I still have to get that bike license from the UCPD.

	
  * Mountain bikes are a GOOD deal heavier than those spiffy road bikes. I've had a ton of grief carrying my bike up and down the BART stairwells.

	
  * I can make a solid grocery store run and carry back everything I need so long as I a) strap on a milk crate to my bike rack with LOTS of bungee cords and b) bring my backpack to carry some excess food.

	
  * In the previous event, the bike will become very rear-heavy. Watch how you throw your weight around on the bike--one bad angle at the wrong speed and you will definitely have spilt groceries.

	
  * Some people can look cool on a bike. I just look dorky.
