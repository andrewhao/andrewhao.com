(Every hour every hour every hour) I need thee every hour. I'm a broken person, and I can't believe how easy it is to forget.  
  
"I kind of wish we were back in first grade" my friend Jon mentioned in the car last weekendï¿½which got me thinking. (Childhood was a blur to me) but for this one memory.   
  
In retrospect I don't know why I did it, but for love. I am about eight, and I lay in my Dad's lap (it is my only recollection of doing so). He puts his hand on my head, and I know I am loved. (Is it strange that I don't know why I did it? Does it even matter?)  
  
In many ways I grew up too quickly, and I long to be a child oftentimes these days. I have this idea it is because I am oftentimes tired, or directionless, or insecure and simply realize that I cannot carry myself.  
  
Man, God, I just want to be a child and know You are.  
  
But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." (Luke 18:16)
