Over the dinner table the other day, my parents and I were talking about my grandpa, and how he's pretty much the jolliest guy you'd ever meet.

He [wasn't always that way](http://www.andrewhao.com/2007/12/27/the-legacies-we-leave/). When my dad was young, my grandpa was still in the Taiwanese military and found himself away for nearly a year at a time. My dad recalled that when his dad came home, he had a temper and wasn't pleasant to be around at all.

But things changed. My grandpa found Jesus. Time passed; there are stories in between the years that I have not been privy to.

I'd remember visiting him in Taiwan and seeing how he'd light up the room with his perpetual smile and a chuckle that was reserved just for you and him. He's gone with his church to China, himself the oldest member of the group by a long shot. My mom and dad chuckle about how he's been featured in a church newsletter--again--for being such a happy character.Â I could see him dazzling folks with his stories, a kind word, a wise word.

It's been about six years since my grandma passed. She was his anchor, a kind-hearted woman with prayer and a soft smile always on her lips. When she passed, I feared for my grandpa, for I didn't know if he could go on much longer. Yet he has, with a visible strength and an obvious joy. And I think he has years of life left in him to live with vigor, compassion, and joy.

May I know that sort of joy--the [Joy of the Gospel treasure](http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Articles/ByDate/1995/1539_How_Shall_We_Fight_for_Joy/)--that allows us to see the hope of Christ in the midst of difficult times. The joy that allows us to love freely and demonstrate grace. The joy that has been passed down, generation by generation, to me, to be known and to be lived.
