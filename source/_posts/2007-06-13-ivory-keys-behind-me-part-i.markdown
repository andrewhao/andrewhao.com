I switched piano teachers in the sixth grade. My first teacher was a kindly, aging American man by the name of John. My earliest memories of piano lessons were of me sitting in an antique chair his dim, musky studio. I'd pretend I was sleeping so I could skim a couple of minutes off my lesson, always to be awakened by a couple of his cats brushing by. I suspect they consulted with some other Chinese parents and came to the conclusion that John didn't push me hard enough. That's when they switched me to Natalia's studio.  
  
Her name was Natalia, but my mother somehow confused it with Natasha. I remember my mother got it wrong on the first day, when she greeted Natalia with a handshake and I peered over at a few of her recital handouts on the piano bench and noticed the correct spelling. This sort of awkward greeting continued over the next five years, but I never did bother correcting my mom.  
  
Natalia was Russian, and we students all knew what that meant--intensity. Russian piano teachers rank at the top of the intensity scale, followed only by Chinese piano teachers (but not by much). Yes, that is a tongue-in-cheek statement.  
  
But yes, Natalia was intense (and I'm pretty sure any number of us could testify about our own piano instructors). I don't know how to describe this facial expression of hers--a cross between concern and intense concentration, perpetually across her face. I think I can count on my fingers the number of times I ever saw her smile.  
  
Okay, so I never practiced. I couldn't! After all I had tons of other stuff to do. Practice was boring. And I always played well enough...  
  
Well enough for me, I suppose. I think every one of those lessons, I got the Glare and/or a lot of nagging and yelling. "Why haven't you practiced?" "This part sounds terrible" "Play this section like I told you to!"  
  
Now all of these statements were true (and well-deserved). But in my mind, I had made up my mind that Natalia was against me. After all, Natalia's roster of students included many to-be prodigies. Actually I think every one of her students was an outstanding pianist who always topped their level in the CM examinations and put beaming smiles on their parents' faces.  
  
I always walked in thinking I was going to disappoint her. And for pretty much every weekly lesson those five years, I walked out feeling frustrated and worthless.
