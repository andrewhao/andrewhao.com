I wrote yesterday about being in a suspension in between "categories" and figured it would do some good to clarify what's going on in my head.

Let's take for example, my identity as a Christ-follower. There are, quite frankly, too many layers for me to deal with on my own:


> This year I've found myself drawn to Reformed theology; finding my heart completely enamored with a God who rules rightly and justly and lovingly and wrathfully in a manner that is a dimension or six over what my human mind can comprehend. My friends in these circles talk about the beauty of the Gospel with so much passion. And yes, I'm a closet John Piper fanboy.

On another level, my involvement with InterVarsity on campus has opened up my eyes to the systemic injustices of this world and how the kingdom of God through Jesus is oriented to "bind up the broken-hearted, proclaim freedom for the captives and release for the prisoners." This theologically liberal approach takes up social justice issues, calling attention to global crises (e.g. framing the suffering in Darfur as a moral issue), calling for political accountability (e.g. debt cancellation to Third world countries as a Biblical concept) and, on a local scale, simple acts of good deeds and justice towards the poor, homeless & needy.

Many of my close friends and family have been Pentecostal folks, living out the realities of the Holy Spirit in everyday life. They _know_ God is real because the Holy Spirit works in the every-day. I know I come into these things with more than a little cynicism, but I've heard and seen more than enough to keep proof positive that the Holy Spirit works today in real, visible, tangible (and intangible) ways (--healings, miracles, knowledge, crazy out-there stuff). And man, have you ever seen anybody live out life more passionately than a Pentecostal? :D

And finally, a nod to my friends who are Emergent-type thinkers, who attempt to take a step back and examine the faith with post-modern tools of deconstruction. The more radical ones will talk about how words & meanings are fluid. They'll do their best to reveal Jesus in a culturally-relevant light. These folks are about the holistic experience of the Divine--in terms of implementation, they experience Jesus in everything from art to dance to poetry to liturgy to YouTube. "Hey--nobody likes 'religion' so let's just tear it all down and start from the basics."


I've come to the conclusion that these camps can't be completely melded into One Awesome Theology because each one begins with a primary value over another. One begins with the Cross, the other begins with the Kingdom, the other begins with Pentecost and the other one, Culture.

But because I've been hanging out in each corner, I see bits of God revealed in each (and, admittedly, see flaws in each, too). I've heard it said that the Gospel is like a diamond with many facets. I'm still somewhat reluctant to find a home in any one camp, for fear that it would flatten this diamond and completely obscure the other facets.

_(Aside: I've been having a very "meta" moment lately as I realize that I'm starting to identify with the Reformed folks and immediately find myself resisting that association--then realizing it's only because I don't like the label. Categories--blast!)_

Don't get me wrong--all this talk about "camps" and theological disagreement shouldn't divide the church (although sadly, it sometimes does). I'd say we all share 80% of the same beliefs--Jesus, essentially--and the other 20% are cause for thought and research and prayer.

I'm really struggling with integration right now. I want to know Jesus in 3-D. I need that solid foundation to stand on. Jesus, I need a clear picture of you.
