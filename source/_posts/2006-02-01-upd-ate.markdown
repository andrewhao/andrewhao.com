Many of you have asked what the sizable bandage on my right hand has been doing there, and why my handwriting has become amazingly retarded in the last few days. I wish I could tell you how I got into a knife fight or about that misadventure in the  army, but...

I was doing the dishes. Got too excited and broke a glass. After noticing blood over the dishes, realized I had sizable gash over my knuckles. Was hoping to let it heal by itself, but after large quantities of blood, decided against it (would have made for an impressive scar and credibility to the knife fight story). The good fellows at the hospital stitched it up good with 10 sutures (if you've ever gotten stitches, it's a surreal experience just watching the physician thread your flesh with blood squirting every which way and since you can't feel it, thinking that this is someone else's hand and you're just watching a show, albeit an uncomfortable one).

It's now at this point I realize I should have warned the squeamish to read no further. Whatever.

But the real point I was driving at was, **hands are amazing, especially when you can use both of them. Freakin awesome.** And when you can only use one, that's still incredible. Wow.
