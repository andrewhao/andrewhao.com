My roommate and I are learning to deal with each other when we're sick with hacking coughs, grumpy and more than a little smelly. Details on who got who sick are a little fuzzy but I'm trying to find the silver lining here: at least we're not deathly ill with meningitis.

I tell David it was kind of fun bonding this week, you know, having been through Pulmonary Hell and back again. "Not really," he points out. "You're getting better and I'm not." Guilt overtakes me for about five seconds.

These days I'm trying to keep myself busy (like I never was) by doing everything I never did last semester.

**Case in Point: **I join the Cal Running Club on their runs on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Now I tried this last week, bright eyed bushy tailed and was summarily owned. No, seriously.

"Stop, I'm being owned," My Body wails.
"Come on, we just gotta stay up with this group" I interject.
My kneecaps make funny popping noises.
"Okay, let's stop."

**Case in Point: **This Friday I started tutoring with some IV folk at World Impact in Oakland. It's a community program that takes kids from the elementary school across the street for after-school tutoring. Man, talk about an ordeal. I sat at the 1st grade table with my friend Sarah and two kids Kezia and Tyrell. Sarah was a pro with Tyrell, going off on numbers and carrying-the-ones and addition and subtraction. I looked at Kezia. She started crying.

We won't go off on too many details besides the fact that on that day, I made my first tutee cry, got kneed in the groin, played ball with three-foot NBA wannabes and pinky-swore to not tell anybody about a girl crush.

**Case in Point: ** I'm realizing how short my time is with the people in my dorms and really trying to make the most of it. Man, life goes by fast. I'm trying to make more time to hang and support and have those late-night-talks and just chill with my floor when I would normally be zombied-out coding a CS project. Mmm, zombie.

**Case in Point: **Finding an internship is a pain in the rear. Especially when I would much rather be doing something more meaningful during the summer. I don't want to be paid nor build my resume. I just want the nitty-gritty of cubicle life.

My original plan was either to do an internship or go on a missions trip. But upon reexamining my reasons to go on a missions trip, I discovered that I want to go more for a feel-good sensation than out of a desire for God to show me his heart. But wait, I assume that God wants me to do a missions trip because that's more Christian-ey. What if God calls me to an internship, cubicle-dwelling for 3 months? What if God calls me to do something totally different, something I haven't factored into my calculations? My applications, resumes, cover letters are all due in the next few weeks. If you guys could pray for my direction this summer, that would be bomb. The bomb.

Spiritually I've been trying to learn how to listen. It's slow going, but it's getting somewhere.

Enough for an early morning. Peace.
