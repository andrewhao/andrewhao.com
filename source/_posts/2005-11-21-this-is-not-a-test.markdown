Talking to Julia last night, I think I'm really starting to realize
That postmodern Christianity (and many parts of me), in its desire for relevancy
Has started to water down and compromise


[**A New Kind of Hipster**](http://www.relevantmagazine.com/pc_article.php?id=7005) - Relevant Magazine
"We are certain we do not want to propagate Christianity through catch phrases and kitsch, and we are dead set against preaching a white, middle-class Gospel to the red-state choir. Perhaps most of all we are tired of burning records, boycotting Disney and shunning Hollywood. We know exactly what the relevant new Christianity must not be???boring, whitewashed, schmaltzy???but we feign to understand just what we should be instead.

"The problem with the Christian hipster phenomenon is not as superficial as the clothes we wear, the music we download or the artistic movies we see, nor is it that we exist largely as a reaction against something else. No. The problem is that our identity as people of Christ is still skin-deep. That our image and thinking as progressives does not make up for the fact that we still do not think about things as deeply as we should. The Christian hipster pretends to be more thoughtful or intellectual than the Podunk fundamentalist, but are we really? We accept secular art and (gasp!) sometimes vote for a liberal candidate, but do we really think harder because we are ???hip"?

"No. The Christian hipster is all well and good, but not good enough. Christians are called to a higher level of critical thought and discernment. We must consider everything, critique it and diffuse the good, true and beautiful...

"Throughout history the movements and revivals of the Church have been rooted in theology. Now it seems we???ve become more concerned with image. What does a Christian look like to the outside world? How can we be more palatable to the hedonist seeker? We???ve jazzed up our worship repertoire, modernized our wardrobe and opened our arms to the masses. All good, except for the fact that we???ve thrown theology to the wind.

"We are to be a counterculture???in and not of the world, accepting yet not acquiescent, flexible but not compromising, progressive though not by the world???s standards. True relevance is not about making faith fit into a hipster sphere as opposed to a fundamentalist box. True relevance is seeking the true faith that transcends all boxes and labels."
