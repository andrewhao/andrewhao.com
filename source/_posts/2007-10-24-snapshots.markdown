Three girls walk down Bowditch Ave at night. They're making lively conversation with a bounce in their step, talking loudly. One stops and slips a dollar bill by a homeless man sleeping under the Urban Outfitters window. She gives a tiny squeal and then quickly skips to catch up with her friends.

The man, now roused, turns to find the bill under his pillow.

Small things like that make me smile. Small things make me realize Berkeley's still got a heart.
