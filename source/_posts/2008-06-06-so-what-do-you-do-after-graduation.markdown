I'm only starting to grasp what it's like post-graduation. I mean, I've walked (in an intense, rainy, 3-and-a-half-hour ceremony). I've said goodbyes to friends moving on. I've moved apartments (goodbye, Royston, you've been good to me). I've started work at Apple, which is pretty sweet.

I feel like I'm done. I think that's what I'm trying to say. I feel like my undergraduate years are behind me. And yes, in spirit, they are. I'm done. I'm working. (This is weird. I'm done, but I'm not--there's still that tiny matter of that last semester.)

I think I want to get out. And then I think I want to stay in academia, forever. I know I'll miss the friendships, late night hangouts, homework (seriously!), flex time in the day, and that general college freedom.

I joke about how weird super-senior year will be--almost like being a ghost, still hanging around but obviously not belonging. "What're you doing 'round these parts?" people will ask me, to which I'll respond, "oh nothin'... just hanging around." Then I'll float on slowly back to my room. I'll start moving on, but not. I'm half there and half here.

But before I can move forward, I want to stop and remember. I want to stop and be thankful for what God's done in my life this semester. I want to acknowledge the highs and lows and come back to the knowledge that these times are the best--and they only get better.

So I'm going to spend the next couple of entries or so looking back and remembering and reminiscing and celebrating the good things. You might even catch a photo or two or twenty. Yes, life moves forward, but I'm going to stay here a bit and catch my breath. Thanks for hanging in there with me.
