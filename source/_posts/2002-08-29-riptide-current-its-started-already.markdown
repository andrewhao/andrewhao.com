who knew that junior year would pull you in so fast? i'm already pretty overwhelmed. gah.. its so crazy.

i got home today at about.. what.. 9:30PM? after school i went straight to ortho appt (no xc for me today.. gonna get out of shape). whereapon when i came back, i scrambled to get to the bandroom to grab my clarinet before my piano lessons. alas, nobody showed up, i ran to the car and sped to piano lessons.

got chewed out (but not as bad) this time. yes.. i think its cuz i'm actually practicing  8O

anyways, i had to speed again back to school right afterwards to pick up my clarinet (thankfully the bandroom was open). sped back home (to get drill charts, doh) and sped to cupertino high for night MB rehearsal.

i did a lot of speeding today. and nearly hit someone in the parking lot. BAAAAD driving habits andrew! sigh.. so much rush.

got home and ate dinner. walked into room and promptly dropped onto the bed and napped till 1:20. woke up and panicked. i still have calc to do and my printer's busy now printing my spanish letter.

so here i am. good night.
