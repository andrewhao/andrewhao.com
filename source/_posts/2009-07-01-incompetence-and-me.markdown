So I'm cutting my hair on Sunday--no big deal, right? I've been cutting my hair for the past eleven years (one mirror, one trimmer and nerves of steel) to varying degrees of success. Well... my standard of success means that after my haircut, I should a) still be recognizable as me and b) not elicit laughter (a compliment here and there wouldn't be bad, either!).




Sunday, I gave myself a pretty bad haircut. It was a really hot evening, and I was impatient to be finished. Well, buzzing trimmer in hand (with no guard), I misjudged the angle of my head and on my way up, and... _whoops!_



In one fell swoop, I had a crater on the back of my head. Further inspection with a mirror revealed the horrifying truth: It was bad; I could give the ozone layer a run for its money. And really, all I could really do was laugh.

I think this was the icing on the cake to a long trial period in my life where I've just realized how uncool and incompetent I am. I'm not very suave. The words that come out of my mouth can be Shockingly Dumb. I can be forgetful, I can be insecure, I can be totally, totally awkward. I'm a Neanderthal.

In short, I can fail in more ways than I ever thought I could, and I'm not as well put together as I thought I was, and that's been super depressing to come to grips with.

I've been learning the hard lessons of who I really am. I've had my pride knocked around a _lot_. Between myself and Sarah, I've discovered that I'm a Total Idiot when it comes to emotions and communication and all that good stuff (who can relate?!).

I've made mistakes at work. I've been a bad friend. I've done a lot of things that just weren't up to par. I'm actually not as good of a guy than I gave myself credit for.

But, maybe that's what leads to the laughing. Maybe this is just it; maybe I'm going through the wringer to get humbled and get a fresh beginning on this post-college life. Maybe this is exactly what it feels like to know how much I need Grace, and to be at my wits' end regarding my own abilities to accomplish anything Good. And maybe there's that joy that... heck. Crater or no crater, I'm loved. I'm not that big of a deal, and that's not that big of a deal.

I know I need God. Dang. That's the one thing that echoes through my mind every morning. I can't make it through the day without your Grace, Jesus. I don't care about anything else.

A verse, ever-quoted through this blog, is James 1:2-5. The words stumble through my lips by losers and failures like me, making them all the more powerful.



> 2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.



So maybe it's going to be okay. I'm still growing. I'm still learning to depend on Jesus.

I'm gonna go find myself a hat.
