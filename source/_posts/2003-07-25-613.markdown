back from mexico, bueno! i'm a bit pooped, so give me some time to collect my thoughts. but here's a small preview:  
  
-awesome fellowship with the guys (male bonding, south valley style ehhehe)  
-good food all around (thank you, stomach of steel)  
-watching God at work and just simply listening  
-playing with the children who just enjoy life  
-YWAM staff that are genuine and plain fun to be around  
  
thanks God.. you've given me what i most needed.  
back to bed ahora... whatta trip =)  
  
-----edit  
nearly forgot something: playing **buckbuck** in the LA base.. now that was truly bueno.
