Two AM in the wrong time zone. My thoughts are swimming with all the wrong things. Television fires fiery images of the dead, dying under burnt ash, collapsed rubble and the ocean that comes in uninvitedly and sweeps things out. Like a thief in the night. Comes in with nothing but a whisper of a sound and leaves with all that is precious. Two AM in the wrong time zone and I cannot synthesize the information and align it to what I should feel. I wrestle with myself and wonder why I can't feel the pain of loss. Why couldn't it have been me that faced skyscraper waves so high, so high that they came tumbling down. What to do what to do what to do; for what, truly, can I do but extend a prayer?
