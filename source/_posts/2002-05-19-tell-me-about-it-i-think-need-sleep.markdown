okay.. so i sit at my computer here and look at my watch. it's 3:07 AM o.O and my contacts are fogged up. no more. haha.. i'll clean up the scripts later tomorrow or something.

i dont expect this blog thing to become a major smash hit or something. my life isnt exactly eventful.. but writing this thing helps me get my thoughts straight and gives me a lil sense of closure at the end of the day. so it's more for **me** than it is for you

i skipped my chinese final today.. and i wont be there for the last week of chinese school cuz of SATIIs. yeah.. so technically i dont have chinese school for the rest of my life. oh my.. thats a bit scary. i feel kinda bad cuz i dont exactly speak well.. not well enough that 10 years of chinese school could justify. in some ways i feel like a failure for quitting. in other ways i coulda seen it coming 4 miles away.. plus next year i wont have time for chinese school. or is that just my excuse?

helped out at the key club DCM today over at the sunnyvale community center. basically there were hordes of kids over there for a crafts faire. the key club helped out with some booths, and i personally helped some kids make paper flowers. yes.. it was interesting. haha.. some of the kids were pretty cute. we went to in-n-out burger afterwards, but i didnt buy anything cuz i ate already

well.. i finished most of my hw (i think?) and i just have chem study sheet to finish up on. psh.. mr flores wont teach next year.. i hope our new teacher's just as good as he was. more on that later, cuz i gotta get to bed.

gnight.
