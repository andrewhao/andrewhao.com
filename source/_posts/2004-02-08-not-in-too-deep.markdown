**i hate polite conversation**

not that i can't make it, but i'm always finding myself wanting to jump five levels deeper beneath the surface with the conversee (is that a word? hm) and the problem is that with deep conversation, i'm never quite sure how to approach it. i'd really love to have it, but i can't breach the subject.

so that's really been frustrating, especially greeting all these new and old faces at church and having all our conversations be so darn surface level. why are we afraid to go deep?

we were talking about fellowship and the christian community, and how the church has gotten a reputation for being condemning and judgemental. ergo, nobody is willing to be vulnerable with each other. it's all true. and leading a small group with the underclassmen guys has simultaneously been a frustrating and an incredibly rewarding experience - frustrating because for the past year or so the guys were so uncomfortable to go deep with each other and we'd just talk about grades. but it's been so incredibly rewarding seeing the guys take that first step to being vulnerable and opening up - just a little. parents, friends, girls, God, you name it. we're not there yet, not by a long shot, but things are starting to change.

so if you find yourself talking to me, know that i'd really love to go a little deeper.
just a little, let's try it out.
