I was out today on a long run (I'm picking up training for the SF Half Marathon in late July). But it was hot... the thermostat was reading 90 degrees at 10 in the morning.




It was a really bad idea.




But I think I finally realized what Psalm 63 means:





> God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you;
   my soul thirsts for you;
my flesh faints for you,
   as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.



Running in the sun with the heat unbearably invading every pore, I think I'm viscerally experiencing what it's like to seek to crave the shade, to be inexorably drawn to it, to seek shelter. It's quite something to have nothing on your mind but the thought of water, to feel your body on the verge of crumbling until you can get yourself to a fountain and drink deeply and unashamedly.

I experienced today what it meant to know and thirst and crave the living God that much as if life itself depended on it. That's how I want to live.
