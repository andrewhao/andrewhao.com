Nighttime finds me running through the city, my footfalls echoing through its canyons and my shadow chasing me as I leave serpentine plumes of hot breath in the January chill. I've traversed the path I'm on countless times already. Left on 8th, down on Harbor, past the glitter of the storefronts advertising their wares, a quick shortcut through the McLeary's yard, away from their dogs and out to the lakefront. I follow the gravel trail a few miles downshore, pushing my legs until the rubbery feeling sets in, then turn around and head back home, exhilarated by the rush.

I pause for a bit when I return onto our front lawn, bent over trying to regain my breath. The moon is full tonight, casting an ivory glow on my tattered t-shirt and dirt-caked Reeboks. Silvery plumes of breath color the air as I spend another minute in the silence of the night air debating whether to open the door, but I know I must. The moment the door creaks open I see Dad, sitting on his customary La-Z Boy throne, fully reclined. He's always clutching the opened classifieds with both his calloused hands. A lifeless Marlboro dangles from his lips, burnt to the stub. He acknowledges my presence with a glance up from the newspaper and a grunt. On the way to the kitchen I fix my eyes to the floor, his eyes never leave the newspaper. Good. It's better that way.

Mom left the house still smelling of raspberry perfume the night that she left. She had grabbed a pad of Post-Its and scribbled _I'll be back_ on the fading yellow paper. I_ _believed it, not wanting to look into the empty dresser drawers devoid of her scent and at a closet now devoid of a suitcase. We found the note on the kitchen counter when we came back home that night. Dad and I had been out to the lakefront, I can remember with frightening detail. We'd walked down Harbor that Saturday night, watching the glittering storefronts on our way to the lake. We'd walked to the edge of the lake, the gravel crunching under our soles and stood there just staring out onto the water and watching the mirror image of the moon and the trees dance in the water. Dad had pulled out his stopwatch: a dime-store timer that hung around his neck on a nylon chain.

Gotten faster this week? he'd asked, and I'd taken off in a sprint down the gravel trail, down to the gnarled tree and back, pounding the gravel like a boxer would, _bam-bam-bam-bam _at least that's what Dad always told me. I'd fought the dizzying numbness in my chest and _fought_ those last fifty meters until I leaned across the imaginary finish line where Dad had pulled out his stopwatch, took one long look at the time and grunted, declaring, "Two seconds slower than last week. Keep your stride length." I hadn't answered, of course, doubled over with my elbows on my knees with stars still crisscrossing my sight, staring at those grey Reeboks. In those precious few moments of silence, Dad had turned around to leave and I slowly jogged to catch up with him down the sandy shore. What I noticed most about that evening was the full moon rising in the sky and the warmth of Dad's hand on my shoulder.

_I'm leavin' on a jet plane.
I don't know when I'll be back again.
Oh, babe, I hate to go._

But that was then. John Denver and ice cream are all I can still remember now. It's strange how that happens; I've already forgotten the look of Mom's face. I grasp at the echoes of winged memories in my mind, but they've all flown away. I can vaguely remember her electric hair, always frizzy and tied into a lazy knot. In the haze of my memory I remember her lips painted raspberry red (with love, she always said), and her cheeks that always gravitated upward in a cheery laugh.

"You and I are alike, Richard" she'd twitter as she tucked me into bed. "We love to run. We're restless." She'd shown up at every track meet that I ran in, leaning over the edge of the dingy bleachers clutching a camera. I'd always given her a thumbs-up before the starting gun went off, she'd respond with her own and a beaming smile. I'd hear her voice rising over the din of the crowd. _Richard!_ she'd cry from the rusting bleachers, her calls becoming louder and louder as I pushed against the wind toward her, then fading to a grandiose whisper as I passed by and the finish line drew near. _Bam-bam-bam-bam,_ that's how you've got to run. I'd cross the finish line with stars in my eyes
and dizzy lungs, and I can still see her silhouette at the finish, always snapping away with her camera. I never saw any of those photos, my photos. I am suddenly imagining her cheering on somebody else's child now, running a breathless race on a foreign track. She clutches her camera and runs in stilted steps to greet him at the finish line. His name is not Richard. I shake the vision from my thoughts.

It's been ten years since Mom left us with only a note and John Denver lazily playing on the record player. I can still feel Dad's hand on my shoulder turn to ice as soon as we opened the creaky screen door. He ran right back out the door, shouting _Nina! Nina!_ at the sky because she had flown away. And I was left clutching an ice cream cone, raspberry red, that I no longer could finish. The alcohol fumes were strong that night when Dad stumbled back into the house. I struggled against his shadowy weight to help him onto the couch. The moonlight was streaming brightly through the window; it fell half on his rising and falling chest while the other half slipped off. I stayed at the windowsill that night watching the full moon fall out of the brightening sky.

The John Denver record's playing again now. I strain to listen to the scratchy guitar from the kitchen, but the only sounds that carry are the sounds of Dad's rhythmic snoring. I can't help but pace the dirty linoleum of the kitchen; the restlessness is churning in my stomach. I feel it suddenly turn; I am sick. I throw on a couple of extra ragged sweatshirts and rummage my room, searching for loose change and dollar bills. I draw back the curtains and look up at the sky. Full moon.

Dad's chest is rising and falling steadily as I tiptoe to the front door. I write him a note: _Back real soon_ and leave it next to the record player. The dewy front lawn masks my footfalls as I cut across the yard, down the sidewalk and break into a dead sprint toward the bus station._Bam-bam-bam-bam_, that's how you've got to run.
