FORGIVE US_
_for judging when we had no right to, for feeling prideful and righteous when we were among the lowest. for pointing fingers and shunning the gay community, for sitting on our lazy butts in our nice churches and driving nice cars and being so ignorant of what really goes on around us; people that hurt, needs that aren't being met, justice that is being denied.

BREAK_
_the media stereotypes that Christianity is about selling your brain to a blind faith. the conception that it's just rules in a book. that high-and-mighty attitude we seem to carry around too often. break us down so that Your reality is the greatest when we are the least.

RESTORE_
_to us real freedom. not a fake smile that we wear and try to sell, but a genuine love that comes out of gratefulness.
