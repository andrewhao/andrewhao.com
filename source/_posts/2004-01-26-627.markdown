**Prestigious University, USA**




**To Whom It May Concern:**







I regret to inform
you that I will no longer be taking the community college math course
Iï¿½ve indicated on my previously submitted application. If you would be
so kind, strike its name out of the record with Sharpie ink on page 3
(ï¿½MATH001C-61ï¿½, if you would). 







Please understand,
itï¿½s not because I couldnï¿½t understand the material. Itï¿½s simply
because Iï¿½m not superhuman, contrary to what all my transcripts, school
reports, teacher recommendations and extracurricular activities would
have you believe.







Please understand, I
had a rough night last night, the majority of my sleep occurred in
between third and sixth period (I have vague recollections on what
happened in between those classes). The flu or cold or cough (or
whatever it is) isnï¿½t helping my body out either. So when I
miraculously made it back from school this afternoon in one piece, I
hope it is understandable how I was able to head straight to bed and
sleep through two straight hours of alarm clock cacophony. By the time
I had awoken and realized it, it was already too late: the test tonight
was already in effect.







Then again, itï¿½s
perfectly unacceptable how I left my math homework unattended to for
much of the week, how I forgot to buy a math book until the third week
of class, how I, honestly, didnï¿½t care to learn Calculus C. Thatï¿½s not
the kind of student you would want in your university, and I can
perfectly see that. I wonï¿½t mind a rejection letter or three. Really.







In fact, attached to
this document is a list of Andrewï¿½s Greatest Failures, ranging from
being a laughable Chinese school student (dropping out two years ago),
an injury-prone runner (unimproved since ï¿½01), an even more laughable
piano player (dropped out two years ago, one mere year from completing
the program), and now, freshly added, is the title of ï¿½Math Class
Dropout.ï¿½ Grade F, they would say.







So if you'd understand, Andrew Hao is not
what his transcript says he is. Hiding behind every flawless
application is a flawed individual hoping not to be seen. Well this is
equivalent to doing jumping jacks in a birthday suit. Iï¿½m okay with
that, maybe it was about time Iï¿½ve failed. You just canï¿½t hide from the
awful truth. Iï¿½m sorry this had to be such a stinker.  
  
Regards,  
_Andrew Hao
