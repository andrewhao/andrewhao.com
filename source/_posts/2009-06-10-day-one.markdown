Since I've been here last, things have changed. I graduated from college, went to Africa, started working in the City, changed churches, moved homes. In the span of one week, I'm in San Francisco, then Emeryville, then Saratoga, then Oakland and back. I've said goodbye to friends, made new ones, and rediscovered old ones.

I gotta be honest, I've never felt so lost in my life.

But this is a good place. This is a different place. I'm going to be sitting down and writing more from here on out. It's my way of keeping track of myself and making sure I'm still here.

This is day one. I am going to start by going to bed.
