okay my dad's making me get to bed right now. so let's see how fast i can recap:

church today.. youth worship was pretty crowded (140 people) and thats really cool. salt meeting afterwards where the new people came in and got introduced and all that good stuff. important stuff ya know.

went to bball afterwards.. realized how long i'd been out of practice. strange thing is, when you cant see the net clearly (soft contacts), thats when you shoot the best. hrm.

youth baptism was tonight. my sister was among the 9 or so youth that got baptised.. really awesome to see so many people supporting the baptiz-ees.. or however you say it. some powerful worship, and had some fun afterwards.

anyways i'm dead tired and yes it's been over 60 seconds. gnight.
