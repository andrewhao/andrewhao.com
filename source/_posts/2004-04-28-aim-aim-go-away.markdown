you know i paid five bucks to download deadAIM to enhance my AIM experience, then right after that i downloaded this program called IMHider so i could hide my IM windows out of sight so I wouldn't keep obsessively keep checking my buddylist every 2 minutes.

now that's addiction. it's time to go cold turkey.
