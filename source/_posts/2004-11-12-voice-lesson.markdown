he sits on the porch-steps in the eight o'clock chill, enveloped by night sky and whispers to nobody-in-particular, "that's what i want." a cool breeze, the lights of the house fading into the lawn and the orange glow of the city on low clouds.

eight years old and all he wants is to sit and listen to his grandmother sing--resonant notes out of a soul wrinkled beautiful by time, trial and age. "that's what i want," she sings, an old melody tarnished by time so she only remembers parts of the tune and no longer can remember all the words. she hums when she can no longer remember the line, but her voice---sometimes on sometimes off--carries out of her thin frame and grows to fill the porch.

he tries to hum along, she tilts her head and smiles and nods to tell him to keep singing. she sings flat but doesn't seem to notice as she continues to nod her head to the tune. he follows suit--slightly flat, humming when the-line-they-didn't-know came up, but mostly just happy to sing into the silence.
