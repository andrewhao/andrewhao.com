I'm here in San Diego with my Mom and sisters, just hanging out. I know I lose man-points for saying this, but I've really missed them.

Remember flying kites in the backyard?
Isn't Dad such a character?
Remember that cherry tree in the backyard? And the swing we put on it?
We miss your cooking so much, Mom. We've been looking forward to it _forever_.
Remember that pinata at Esther's birthday party like... 12 years ago?
Man. What a sunset.
