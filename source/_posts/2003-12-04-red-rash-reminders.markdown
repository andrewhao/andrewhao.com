IT BURNS. ohhhh my goodness it burns.

it's taken over my arms and legs. red, splotchy patches are multiplying over my skin. we thought it was eczema, the doctor says it's an allergic rash reaction to something, all i know is that it burns, and i can't scratch it. yowch.

**in everything give thanks...

God was putting that verse in my heart last night, and i was like **you gotta be kidding me, God.** all i wanna do is jump in some ice cold water and stay there, problem being it's like 40 degrees outside and inside's not much warmer.

okay God, i know i'm a natural-born whiner at heart. but i'm gonna give You the glory. yeah, that's right. You get the glory through my suffering. ow. ow. thanks, God. you keep reminding me how much i need You.

ah, good ol itchiness. yowza. we'll see how this goes.
