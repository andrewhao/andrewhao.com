whooooooooo them SATs were sure interesting. and horrendously horribly horrible. to recount:

6:30 - alarm clock goes off, i never notice it.

6:45 - stereo timer goes off, blasts some music (which i'm too groggy to recognize). get out of bed, trudge over and turn it off.

6:50 - i realize my alarm clock has been going for the past 30 minutes, i flip the "off" switch.
**fatal mistake:** back to bed, i'll wake up in 5 minutes, right?

7:50 - i guess not. i suddenly sit up and stare at the clock. boy, it's only 6:50?!

my head nearly hits the pillow before i catch a glimpse of the clock again out of the corner of my eye. **that ain't a six.**

7:55 - panic, panic, and some more panic. out of the house, no breakfast, no pre-test studying. i speed (somewhat) on the way to del mar (which the last time i've been there was like.. three years ago).

8:10 - i arrive, walk into the room and realize my neck hurts. also, i can't write cursive very well. well, it's time to kick booty on this test, eh? more bubble-filling, and why do you need my social security number..

9:00 - pre-test drudgery ends, let the fun and games begin.

9:00 - 10:00 - test book opened, face falls, brain (and calculator) explode, expectations lie in ruins.

10:05 - i take my five minute break, wandering the campus in a dazed stupor.

10:20 - 11:20 - chem test. see above, only worse.

11:30 - i need something to take away the pain. oo look.. a fry's electronics store. mecca.... i cant resist.
