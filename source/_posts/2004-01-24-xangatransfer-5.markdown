i'm dreaming more often nowadays, but somehow they're not of the type that are particularly memorable. you know, no death-defying action scenes worthy of hollywood, i think the closest i got was waiting in line at a McDonalds. or maybe the time i dreamed i was nodding off in bio class, now tell me if that's not a) ironic and b) terrifying.

maybe it's a subconscious nudge telling me to treasure every moment no matter how mundane it is because my life needs to be lived out to the fullest. or maybe i'm just making up excuses to sleep in a couple more hours =)

_ack, i'm so sorry. i dont have a clue what you're going through. that's what scares me, i can't empathize. and i apologize because i should have done something so much earlier. give me chance. i'd like to hear what you have to say, if you'd drop your facade for just a moment..._
