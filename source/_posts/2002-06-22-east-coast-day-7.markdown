we took the bus tour of manhattan today.. haha it was pretty interesting cuz the bus driver would stop every block or so and totally block traffic just so we tourists could get a good shot of whatnot hehe..

my dad wanted to go see everything when i personally wouldn'tve minded if we just stopped and sat and slept =D my feet really hurt really bad... i'm not exactly a walking person, mind you. and all this sightseeing was really killing me.

yeah, but we did get to see a lot of the sights. and at night we went up to top of the empire state building.. very very nice views (would've been better if it werent as crowded, but hey who's complaining?)

SAT scores got released tonight, but i couldnt log into the collegeboard.com server cuz it was apparently down. figures.. well i'm not sure if i wouldve wanted to see em anyways. im not feeling very optimistic about my scores.. we'll see tomorrow.

well i'm gonna crash. figuratively. goodnight.
