ever wondered about that? what it's like to faint?

so what's the deal, guys. is it like falling asleep (only really fast?) do your legs get all weak and quivery and suddenly you're falling down? or maybe you start seeing stars and then the world starts spinning and fade to black. or maybe it's like the movies, with the whole extended sigh and the slo-mo falling and then the guy rushes out to save the girl who is about to faint off a cliff or something ridiculous like that  :)

okay i only bring up this subject because i nearly fainted today (or was it yesterday? my memory's fuzzy) cuz of the heat during track practice. it was deliriously wonderful.

speaking of which, today was probably my last ever real track practice with the team. rancho san antonio, 80ish weather, nothing but dust and the long trail uphill. sawdust mouth, stars in your eyes and cruelty in your legs. i finished hard and it was just like i'd imagined it'd be: incredibly painful and feeling good. okay i sound simultaneously nerdy and insane.

today i was praying with a couple of guys and somebody prayed for God to bring us "seasons of suffering" so we could trust in God more. my gut reaction was "don't say that.. are you crazy?!" and the more i thought about it the more i realized that all the hardcore movers and shakers all abandoned their lives to God, lived out pretty gritty lives but got blessed INSANELY with some holy spirit. but just hearing one of my bros say it out loud really shocked me at first. made me think.

i'm out like the remnants of your bean burrito. peace.
