So a side effect of last night's code jam was a complete. brain. shutdown.  
  
My CS prof gave me a funny look when I walked in to turn in my group report and asked if I was all right. I turned around, couldn't think of what to say, so I just walked out.  
  
Then in MC102 discussion I started to say something then realized I really didn't have anything to say (but kept talking nonetheless). Do you ever have one of those out-of-body moments when you start talking and then cognitively realize you're hearing your own voice and get somewhat mesmerized by it? Like, wow, I'm talking and that's my voice and... it sounds like nonsense. Luckily I crashed the plane in a recoverable fashion and shut up for the rest of section.  
  
I was going to skip 162 lecture today but my GSI saw me and I couldn't walk out on him. So I napped on my arm. Best nap ever.  
  
I think I'll take out my contacts now.
