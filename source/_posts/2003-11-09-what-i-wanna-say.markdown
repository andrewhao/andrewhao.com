here's what i wanted to say last night:

i nearly wanted to laugh out loud last week. you know the push in part 2? horns up, four count drive to the push? gosh i felt a smile tugging at my mouth. i just couldn't help but smile.

so don't forget the joy. march it tonight. and know that i will be laughing, _crying_, enjoying every moment of it with you.
