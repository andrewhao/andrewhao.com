Mike's been doing well lately. He's got a place to stay at in Oakland, and does odd jobs around the area to keep himself going. He doesn't even take me up on my offers to get him a meal anymore. "Go on 'head Drew, I'm all right." I feel kind of bad, though, because I haven't been seeing him as much as I could be. "Things have been crazy," I tell him, and he understands in a way that I didn't expect him to.

It's been about a full year since we first met, and it still amazes me I'd get to know Mike like this. And thank you--Justin, Sarah, Joanna, Steve, Ruth, and anybody else--who've paused and given a little bit of your time, your change, your prayers, a meal, your listening ear to a brother. Much love to David and Hatty and all those other folks who wrestle with daily interactions with the homeless. We're not perfect, we're not always brave, but we're the Body and we're taking a step :D
