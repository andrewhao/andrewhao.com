I get kind of excited to think about what I could be doing in the next step of my life. The idea of working in an area of industry I'm passionate about, striking out on my own, entering new relationships, and managing new responsibilities is really attractive (and deathly frightening, but I've already [covered that](http://weblog.xanga.com/gsgnine/623210685/item.html)).

The idea that I have so many things to learn, so many places to go, and so much character to develop is intruiging to me. I think this is a byproduct of being really dissatisfied with who I am now (I feel too young). So when anticipating this after-college transition puts my identity in flux, I start itchin' to get to the final part.

I can't believe that two years ago I thought I had it all figured out. These days, I have far less to be confident about, and I think that's a good thing. I have so much more to experience; I have so much more to try, fall, fail & learn.

One of the authors in Scripture describes life as a foot race, in which he "presses on toward the goal" for the "prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus." God forbid I give up now.
