**friday:** we loaded up the buses still a little groggy (i woke up at 6AM.. that's never happened since last may..) and we had a small commissioning service in the main hall. then we said goodbye to some awaesome counselors and whoo.. off we go on 2 packed buses.

after stopping at a rest stop and a walmart for some Wet Ones Wet Wipes (dubbed Shower-In-A-Can) we hit up the mexico border and praise God.. we're waved through without any incident. no pain, no twenty five buck fee, no passports.. nuttin'. awesome to see a prayer answered.

thomas and i next to a.. um.. "dog run" sign we found at the rest stop.

thomas runs the gauntlet. don't ask.

when we hit mexico there's definitely a bit of culture shock. the houses there are puny shacks.. i don't even know if shack is the word. they're walls of random flat panels. plywood, broken glass panels, metal sheets, you name it. we're fifty feet from the mexico-US border, on the other side are nice seaside apartment condos and here the contrast is incredibly huge. dogs run free on the street, little children come up to you and beg for change. either that or they sell little trinkets for their mothers who are also pleading you to buy their necklaces and wristbands, insisting _one dollar_ - the only english phrase they know.

and you look into their eyes and you wonder _why them, God?_ why did i have to be blessed with so much when these people roam the streets, defeated?

at night we broke off into groups and did some praise and prayer on the streets. it wasnt until then, when we were gathered in a circle singing and praising and just loving on God and asking for an overflow of his presence that God really began to move as i felt in my heart. dah i can't explain it.. it was just a simple overflow of love. no fancy guitars, no beautiful voices and no fancy stages but simply a group of on-fire youth praying for God's blessing on Mexico.

i love how the YWAM base has such an intense focus on prayer... the staff is so drawn into the power of prayer and they're so into worshipping and praying at the same time (angela li called it retreat-style prayer, we call it agape-style prayer =D). it's awesome to see that the fire i saw in people such as dan lui isnt exclusive to him but to youth everywhere, yes, even in mexico.

dorms are intensely crazy as i soon found out. 20 guys in a space about the same size as my room is definitely a.. new experience. triple-bunk beds and foam mattresses. i'm not going to call em ghetto cuz honestly they werent so bad. whee we have a lot of fun in these.. haha these guys know how to have fun. maybe in an iffy sense, but it's still fun. I'm sleeping next to **Thomas Chen **aka Gas Machine ("a fart not heard is a fart wasted"). what a monster. still cool though... we've had a ton of time to bond and he's a vibrant and fun-to-be-with dude.. its a blessin to "okayha" and "alrightha" with him.

**saturday:** i'm sitting here in the El Bananas Cafe across the street from the base and it just hit me how **relaxing** this was. pencil in hand, lounging in a stool and watching the bustling tijuana street life under the sunset. i remember four months ago i was drowning in schoolwork and responsibilities and wow.. what a great feeling! the ocean's a hundred feet away (we cant get in cuz of health issues, of course =( ) but still.. the food's pretty decent, the power of God is here and so close and i've got so many great friends around me.. i feel great! tijuana is such a lively city with lovable people, its own mix of sounds and sights and its own atmosphere.

the el bananas cafe: shakes to die for (not due to food poisoning)

we found some street children yesterday right outside the base and had a blast playing with them. they have so much life and energy - how can you resist them? ear-to-ear smiles all around. but man.. when they're selling trinkets and whatever.. they are the saddest things you've ever seen.. pitifully asking you to buy their little gadgets and bracelets. kids must grow up fast here and learn street smarts early on.

so much life.. that's cristian on my back and rosalito (?) on debbie wang's shoulder.

i think its possible to be too busy for God.. even on a missions trip like this one. im gonna spend some more time in prayer and just listening cuz i'm finding myself distracted by so many things.

**sunday:** i'm standing on the sidwalk overlooking the ocean and i'm watching the waves crash onto the beach.. but i'm watching through a barbed wire fence. God's blessing and power are ready to enter Mexico but something's holding it back, like that fence..

break the barriers, God. break the dependencies. crash through these walls and come like a flood.

so much stuff to write down:

_sunday service:_ we worked with Pastor Garza in a church pretty close to our building site.. did some sunday school work with the kids (man i think the older kids are making fun of me and my broken spanish =D) and then broke for lunch.

the team arrives at the church.

we're working with the kids here.

the main service began after lunch and we began with worship.. wow.. the mexican worship style is so lively and so boisterous (that's the word for it). i would describe it as **pure joy**.. clapping (the mexican people clap on the downbeats of the song.. interesting), shouting and a whole lotta jumping (even the old grandmas). "imagine if we had that in the asian churches" -peter fong

awesome to see them worshipping.. echoing "amen"s and "hallelujah"s to every other sentence the pastor said. "this is just like being in the african american church!"

i was asked to share a testimony again and i decided to keep it simple this time.. Chad the translator translated (duh) and bless his heart.. cuz that job ain't easy.

tijuana on sundays must either always be this busy or it's just today that the beaches are P-A-C-K-E-D. there's a huge line of cars outside doing... something (cruising, i guess?)

i gotta learn to give up some jealousy.. a lot of hard feelings just came up today out of nowhere. gah i let my ego get in the way so many times. God, you've got a long way to go with me.

anqi shared something about whether you know something is God's voice or just your own. i believe that it will be God's voice it it is confirmed with multiple sources and if it keeps **buggin** ya. (i was talking to my mom about this and she told me that God will give her a specific bible verse.. that's pretty good advice)

talked again with jason just a few minutes ago.. he really encouraged me to dream big. God's clearly been calling him and he's heard it so clearly and so definitely. it was cool to just talk with him there in the tijuana night air.

that was part II of the log.. more to come!
