gah.. i realized how weak i still was today when we went up to rancho to run in the hills for our workout.. i dunno. i just don't have enough push to keep going up the wildcat switchbacks and it's the worse feeling in the world when you slow down on a hill - cuz that means more pain for a longer period of time.

i guess that means more bleachers after workouts.. man whoever thinks that track is an easy sport has never actually done it.

oh, props to the varsity guys relay 4x100 and 4x400 teams (top in CCS) who are currently down in SoCal doing their thang.. hahah you guys deserved that article.. and so much more. good job and good luck!

gonna go watch that musical tomorrow.. we're rounding up a lynbrook/CCIC crew to go see it too. i hear it's awesome awesome awesome from all that i've talked to so i'm pretty amped to see it  :)

other than that, i've reserved this weekend for homeworking, AP slacking, some quality time on the piano and some website duties.

since i'm gonna be scanning and the such for the rest of tonight, check out what's happened **in the wake of the week**

and on a parting note: it's a real good feeling when you find something you thought you'd lost before. really good. especially if that thing belonged to your parents. phew.
