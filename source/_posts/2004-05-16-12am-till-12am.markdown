it was big and it was on a boat. that's as far as i can summarize tonight. a big thank you to christine for putting up with my responsibilities as a photographer and incredible dorkiness on the dance floor - i had an incredible evening  :)

---------OKAY FROM THE TOP
so let's start from the beginning. DYC Call Extreme was really incredible.. just a time of total freedom in worship and prayer, the presence of God was so THERE. there was just no way to describe it.

so that was pretty cool; i ended up leaving downtown about 3:30, thinking that my photo time was at 4:30 and i could make it to school on time, right? alas, according to Law of Formals, "on time" is never on time. rats! should have reminded myself of that.

okay picked up flowers along the way, went home took a shower and fought with my hair while christine calls and tells me to get my butt over to radhika's house which i say i'm coming right that instant. then i continue to fight the hair for a good chunk of time and have a mishap involving the misplacement of my shoes.

but it works out. sort of. now we're 15 minutes past photo time. oh well.

got to radhika's house (sort of) and we were off to lynbrook for photos! she learned along the way how to pin a boutinnere (thank goodness, i was a little worried with the whole sharp pointy objects deal), and i learned how to spell that darn word.

i, rushing back home to get the camcorder, realize along the way my SLR (statement of legal residence) for berkeley is due. thank goodness i remembered that, otherwise this would have been the most expensive dance in my life (oh, upwards of several grand)

i, armed with camcorder and camera, encounter several handsome men and beautiful ladies at school. everybody looks insanely refined, which speaks not for their real personalities.

massive photoshoot aside, we all board the buses (400-500 so people). we realize that, no, we're not bus 9 but rather bus 1. it's a long walk of shame.

sleep is Good. hello SF, hello Belle (it's one big beautiful boat)

2 dance floors, awesome food with a kick-butt view to boot. the boat took a wide lap around the bay, passing by Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge.. that was awesome.

when i dance i tend to go dorkus maximus. it's still legal though, and hey who cares anyways? i think the pink tie helped a bit. christine needs to loosen up on song analysis.. and JUST DANCE FOR HEAVENS SAKE.

i sleep on the way back. thankfully, no drool on the tie.
