I don't normally do this, a blow-by-blow recap of the week. But I'm doing it now, because I woke up this morning and thought "I don't normally do this, a blow-by-blow recap of the week." So I'm doing it.

**Extreme makeover**
So I'm heading back home this weekend, for the first time since the start of the semester. Is it because I intensely miss my family and friends back home? Well, yeah. Is it because I long for some home-style cooking? Well, yeah. Is it cuz I need to stock up on fatty snack foods and instant ramen? For sure. But mostly it's because I need to get a haircut, and I can't shell out 15 bucks for   a haircut up here. It's the principle of saving money, and I blame my dad for instilling this miserliness in me. Yeah, yeah, I miss you too.

**The real world**
So the scrapping of the bedheaded scrubbiness for a new 'do is mainly because I'm talking to some folk from a local tech company this week in my pathetic attempts to find an internship this summer. A little scary in the respect that if I take on the role, I'm responsible for an actual job. This is unprecedented in my world, and more than a little worrisome. Can I handle a desk job? What if my stuff's not up to par? And most of all, what if I smell funny?

**Feeling the love**
Last night I was kickin it at Justin's place (aka Koreatown) just chillin. Number one, it's significant that these upperclassmen even invited me over at all. And while we were talking I just kept getting impressed by the fact that these guys were passionate about what they did, be it in their studies, their artistic gifts, their visions and whatnot. It was like sitting in an All-Star locker room. You could smell it, but that just might have been Justin's All-Star gas. Sorry, I had to say that.

**Huffing and puffing**
The weather's been unusually warm and nice and breezy and so I went up to Strawberry Canyon today to run the fire trails. Man, it's so darn beautiful up there and when you get to the top you can see the whole bay. The hard part is getting up to the top, because of my accumulated freshman fifteen weighing me down. What can you do?  8O

**Spirit move**
God's been showing me how to have victory over a lot of things I've been struggling with. I've been praying for breakthrough for the longest time, and this week it was like God pulling back just a lil' on what it's like to have that kind of victory. praise God, It's pretty sweet.
