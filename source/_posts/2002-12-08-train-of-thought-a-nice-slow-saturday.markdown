today was one of those days that i've been dreaming about for a long time.

that is, i did:

1. **nothing**
2. **nothing**
3. **nothing**

woke up at a very leisurely 12:30.. just in time to miss lunch  :(  but that was all right.. i wasnt too hungry anyways. my dad went out to buy a christmas tree and brought it back. it was funny how he was so proud of the good deal he got on it. it's a bit on the shrimpy side but it's all good  :)

since it was so sunny i decided to go wash the car. that was the easy part.

waxing, however, was a different story. since last time i was only able to wax half the car, i felt it was only fair to the other half that it get waxed too =P. little did i know, and little did my tired puny arms know how long it'd take.

yeah, now i know why that karate kid got so good. bleh. wax on.. wax off.. repeat 90392034324234 times. was it worth it? maybe.

went to michelle's party for the seniors (low on gas on the way there.. was wondering if i'd have to like coast there on an empty tank). wow.. i've never seen so much food in my life.. mmrph.. good stuff  :) a lotta fun. too bad the warriors lost to the mavs. bleh.

i just realized how much preparation is involved in winter formal. lots and lots of it. wow.

anyways.. gotta get going now. do some hw then sleep. tomorrow's a busy day..
