it's time to move on. i'm gonna edit this entry in a bit when the right words come to me.

to all: thanks so much. you've shaped me into who i am today.

to update on, sooner or later:
-summerness (bowling, YSP, friends)
-how we really say goodbye, and whether it turned out the way we imagined them
-senior sendoff
-ccic sr beach trip
-worship
-God
-gonna miss the family
-packing up (how do you pack up your life?)
-unfinished jobs and the miserably failed to-do list.

oh yeah, to do: yearbook entries before i leave.
