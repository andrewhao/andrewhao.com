There is a strange art installation in the side of the Vuitton store here in the mall that my family walks through each night--a neon-rimmed iridescent parabolic reflector behind wall-to-wall glass, a bright bulb in the middle directing light into the center of the mall. Returning the gaze of the giant iris evokes a haunting fear of waking a sleeping giant.

Inscribed on the glass--"Eye See You."

The people of Hawaii are beautiful, every single one of them. They (as do we) come to the malls to buy into the promise of being more so, because companies are telling them they have blemishes to cover, muscle tone to build, bodies to flaunt, trends to keep up. Why? Because they are being watched. Who is? Nobody can tell me.
