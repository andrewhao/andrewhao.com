okay, so the dealie is that i dozed off again by accident. again. and the dealie is that i havent actually had any planned (like 12 - 7) sleep on weekdays in a month or so. just kinda.. curl up in a ball wherever i am and take a 3-hour nap.. then panic for the remainder of the time until school begins again.

some people bore you with what they did during the day. i bore you with what i do during the _night_.

anyways the spanish group came over today and sort of messed around in my house.. hahaha our newspaper looks quite the interesting. and my floors are sticky from the poster spray or whatever that stuff is.

dozed off after dinner.. when i woke up andrew yip showed up totally unexpectedly at the door with PMT - "you need the caffeine!" hahaha you dont know how much that helped bro.. that meant a lot to me  :D

grapes of wrath = soporific. finished 150 pages in 90 minutes from 3:00 to 4:30AM and currently i remember about zero of it. drooled a little in the book as i dozed off in it... again.
