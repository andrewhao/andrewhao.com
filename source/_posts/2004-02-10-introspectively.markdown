can't let go
who can save me from myself

oh you stand like a flower
and you break like the winter
how unfortunately all that your worth is suppressed
and it's all you invest but you call it your best
introspectively me

do you believe when the curtain is drawn
do you believe when the promise that you make,
then break,

won't go..

something like silas - introspectively
-------------------------------------------

just got the SLS 'Glimpses' cd yesterday and this track stood out so much.. not just musically or lyrically speaking (it's hauntingly beautiful) but the entire emotion of it captured something that i've been trying to elusively describe to myself for awhile.
