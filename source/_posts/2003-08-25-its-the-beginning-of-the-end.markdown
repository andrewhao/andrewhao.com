first day of school was a lotta fun! there's something about being a senior.. stepping on campus, surveying all in your territory as the underclassmen all gasp in awe at your awesome awesomeness and you serenly gaze over all that is in your kingdom named Lynbrook..

well maybe not really. but i did manage to help out a frosh today! he came up to me and asked "um.. where's room 77?" and i, in all my awesome awesomeness and responsibility cultivated as an awesome link crew leader respond intelligently with "um.. uh.. i don't really know either....."

back to the senior thing. there's something about being a senior i suppose. while this summer was at times, filled a whole lot of stress and pressure, i also learned to bring out that exuberance and excitement and throw away all traces of dignity. ergo, some prime examples of this newfound character traits would be: shamelessly laying the beat with kenji in a new "heartbeat" remix -  punk rawk/hip hop style, shamelessly victory dancing whenever required, and shamelessly letting loose a whole lotta "yeeeehaw!"s

something about being a senior. and having no shame :lol: but seriously.. i find myself a lot less self-conscious. i wanna live a life that's unrestrained and lived to the fullest (ignore the cheesiness please). i'm learning that your image only goes as far as your fear - your fear of how much or how little you want of yourself to be revealed. there's a lot to be said about being genuine, yet so little of it around here.

seems as if most my teachers are pretty good this year.. i can see already that mrs. loia (bio) and mrs. baugher (eng) are good teachers already.. they also teach the classes that i have to fear the most  :!:

so yeah, not to say that the pressure's totally off either: SATIIs, club responsibilities, xc practices, piano lessons, band rehearsals, and a full load of 4 AP classes. it's going to be a challenge.

KRON 4 news crew at lynbrook! they were doing this piece on the new homework reduction policy (more on that later) and so we tried to get in the picture by walking across the camera in the far background. no idea if it came out though...  8O

and i've wasted enough time working on this post.. getting a move on. take care all.
