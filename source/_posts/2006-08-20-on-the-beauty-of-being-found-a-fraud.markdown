When your castle of gilded cards falls down and your fraudulent
kingdom has burnt to ashes, when skeletons in your darkened nooks lie bare
naked in the everglow of a steady Lightï¿½thatï¿½s when you breathe, my friend. Thatï¿½s
when you know you walk the earth with Kings and thieves alike.  You have started over with the lowest of the low,
naked as the day you were born. O the heights from which youï¿½ve fallen!





_I am full of earth and
dirt_





And your Father is running to you. Do you see? Off in the
distance, heï¿½s running like mad. You canï¿½t see it now past paparazzi camera
flashes; you canï¿½t hear it now over the din of cruel laughter. You canï¿½t feel
it over your shame and disappointment and grief. But here he surely comes
running, wrapping his arms tight around your soiled clothes and whispers in
your ear _Son, you are still My son_.





Thatï¿½s when you can discard the troubles of the upkeep of a
fading faï¿½ade and you breathe, knowing  simply
that you, broken, humiliated and unworthy have nothing to boast in except in your
Father. Breathe in deeply & sweetly, for the stale air has been knocked out
of your lungs. Take your first hesitant step into the warmth of the Light and press
on.





(Of course, by ï¿½youï¿½, I mean ï¿½meï¿½)





_But a certain sign of
grace is this: from the broken earth, flowers come pushing through the dirt._





_This is the verdict:
Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because
their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the
light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be
exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the
light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done
through God. (John 3:19-21)_
