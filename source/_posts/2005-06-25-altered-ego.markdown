I'm gonna be honest. I really envy the lives of other people sometimes. Real bad. I find myself reading total strangers' blogs and getting sucked into their worlds, where I too can mill through their parties, blankly mugging at their everywhere cameras. Some part of me wishes to be able to drop Greek letters like dollar bills and rock parties in designer shirts. What's it like? Get blazed with four other young twenty-somethings you've met for all of forty-five minutes and dazedly grin like you've just cheated death. What do they know that I don't?

I'm going to continue this brutally honest streak because it's going somewhere. I am truthfully a little tired of living with the label of "good Christian boy." I sometimes wish that my life didn't seem so picture-perfect, so orderly and clean. So boring. And so a part of me wants rebel. "Life is good," the photos with the glamorous people and heady drinks tell me, "and you don't get it."

And so that gets me worried. Worried that people will look at me or read my stuff and think that I "just don't get it." That my Christian good-kid upbringing will rob me of friends or girls or good times. People I know, my close friends, even, will avoid inviting me to do certain things with them because, well, of me. That bothers me. And suddenly I'm thinking up ways I can push the limits a little, cheat death some more, live it up, ya know?

My head's spinning by now. Who am I anyways? What defines me, and why am I feeling this way?

And I realize I'm not being true to myself--nor my God--if I follow through. I'm not going to preach here. But I will say that my life has been blessed to the overflow by a God who promises to be more than enough for me.

I wanted to be honest because I really do struggle with these things. I want to find acceptance with the hip crowd who do things a certain way. And to be honest, I probably could do them and be fine. But it would totally be a lie to who I am and who I live for. And ultimately, that would hurt more than any longing for acceptance.

Okay, this post has gotten beyond weird. Do you have any comments? Go through the same things? Think I'm a total pretentious jerk? Let me know what you think!
