So for my International Media class (MC160) I've chosen a semester focus on the Taiwanese blogosphere. It somewhat excites me, because these bloggers give a slightly different pulse on the Taiwanese people in a way that I'm told is unrepresented in the mainstream media. I want to read about frustrations and simple joys, dissidence and politics, pop culture and resistance to the West. I want to know of everyday life in my people.  
  
It pretty much intimidates me as well. Hey all you Taiwanese-Americans, tell me you have a fragmented identity. Tell me you don't always know if you're "green" or "blue". Tell me that you turn blind eyes to what goes on back "home" because, well, you find following the news draining. Tell me you don't quite have a firm stance on any sovereignty issues. Cuz I hope I'm not the only one. In many ways, this project is about rediscovering identity, relearning history and tapping into deep wells.  
  
Here, I'm going to post anything interesting from my research as the semester goes on. We'll see how it goes.
