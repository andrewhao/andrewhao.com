I finally put my finger on what I dislike about [Technical Writing](http://sis.berkeley.edu/OSOC/osoc?p_term=SP&x=0&y=0&p_classif=--+Choose+a+Course+Classification+--&p_deptname=Engineering&p_presuf=--+Choose+a+Course+Prefix%2FSuffix+--&p_dept=&p_course=190&p_title=&p_instr=&p_exam=&p_ccn=&p_day=&p_hour=&p_bldg=&p_units=&p_restr=&p_info=&p_updt=).  
  
You have to restate yourself and where you are, all the time. Introductions are cookie-cutter. Everything is a formula. Every paragraph, you pick up the two-by-four of Blindingly Obvious and smack your reader across the face. Multiple. Times.  
  
Man, [Dilbert](http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/the_characters/html/character4.html) was right. I pity the tech writers of the universe.
