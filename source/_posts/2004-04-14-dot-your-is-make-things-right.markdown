whoa, sorry. i don't think i've really taken the time to address this.. don't think i even realized this myself till i was convicted of this a couple of weeks ago. something in my pride distanced me from you this year. forgive me, it was something totally judgmental in me, something i had no right to do. i wanna apologize but i'm not quite sure how. and i don't know how writing it here is gonna help it, but i intend to do this in person.
