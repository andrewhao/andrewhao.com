This week has been playing catchupcatchupcatchupcatchupcatchupcatchupketchup?

And to those of you whom I've been telling that I've been "stressed" -- I'm actually not.

Just really busy. But kind of thankful.

Just a few minutes ago (this is 2AM) I was chewing on some plasticky sushi and drinking Lime Coke (and you know when it's still too fizzy when you open the 20oz bottle and you wince when you drink it anyways). And just enjoying that simple moment.  Lime Coke and Sushi. Me and God at the dinner table. Somehow I like that.

Somehow FAQQLY and my two problem sets and five or so queued webcasts and a CS project don't seem so bad.
