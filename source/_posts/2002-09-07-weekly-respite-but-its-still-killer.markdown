so i was up till 3 last night figuring out the xc tshirt design (and it still looks kinda funky). and my printer doesnt have the right color when it prints. but that's not the point here. it's done.. finally.  8O

yesterday night at CIA was pretty interesting. pastor thomas (feels weird calling him "pastor" haha) and the drama team did some hilarious comedy improv with the announcements. we threw out some emotions for the people up there to do and it turned out hilarious. anyways peter and julie were up there to discuss emotions - oo thats some deep stuff. they basically answered some survey questions taken last week. but yeah.. i thought that this kinda thing was really fun.

agape activity (ribbon folding) today - in about 30 minutes from now i'll need to leave. anyways, i havent been able to contact my fellow core teammates (i lost their phone numbers!) so i hope i'm not out of the loop or anything haha. man i respect them all.. they've got CONTROL over their online time  :!:  and so you can figure out why i can't use AIM to get to em.

but hey.. if you're reading this (and it's between 10AM-4PM).. stop on by! it's at **seung oh's** house. _6710 Wisteria Way, San Jose_

well i better put on an away message.. gotta prep to leave. i'll try to post my biweekly (or that's how its been working out) thoughts a bit more often now haha.

er oops.. gotta kick myself off from this computer.
