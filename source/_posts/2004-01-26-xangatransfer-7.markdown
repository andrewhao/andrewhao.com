To Whom It May Concern:

I regret to inform you that I will no longer be taking the community college math course I???ve indicated on my previously submitted application. If you would be so kind, strike its name out of the record with Sharpie ink on page 3 (???MATH001C-61???, if you would).

Please understand, it???s not because I couldn???t understand the material. It???s simply because I???m not superhuman, contrary to what all my transcripts, school reports, teacher recommendations and extracurricular activities would have you believe.

Please understand, I had a rough night last night, the majority of my sleep occurred in between third and sixth period (I have vague recollections on what happened in between those classes). The flu or cold or cough (or whatever it is) isn???t helping my body out either. So when I miraculously made it back from school this afternoon in one piece, I hope it is understandable how I was able to head straight to bed and sleep through two straight hours of alarm clock cacophony. By the time I had awoken and realized it, it was already too late: the test tonight was already in effect.

Then again, it???s perfectly unacceptable how I left my math homework unattended to for much of the week, how I forgot to buy a math book until the third week of class, how I, honestly, didn???t care to learn Calculus C. That???s not the kind of student you would want in your university, and I can perfectly see that. I won???t mind a rejection letter or three. Really.

In fact, attached to this document is a list of Andrew???s Greatest Failures, ranging from being a laughable Chinese school student (dropping out two years ago), an injury-prone runner (unimproved since ???01), an even more laughable piano player (dropped out two years ago, one mere year from completing the program), and now, freshly added, is the title of ???Math Class Dropout.??? Grade F, they would say.

So if you'd understand, Andrew Hao is not what his transcript says he is. Hiding behind every flawless application is a flawed individual hoping not to be seen. Well this is equivalent to doing jumping jacks in a birthday suit. I???m okay with that, maybe it was about time I???ve failed. You just can???t hide from the awful truth. I???m sorry this had to be such a stinker.

Regards,
_Andrew Hao_
