I don't like easy answers. This is a consistent theme in everything I do.

I hate cliches. I don't like following traditions, or following predefined paths. Something about being able to blaze your own trail and say that you've done it yourself.

In my conversations: I am wary of easy answers. "Just trust God" or "Have you prayed about it?" Some part of me just refuses to believe that it could be that easy, or is afraid of being the formulaic poster child.

Or in my writing: I love writing about things that don't make sense, or are borderline blasphemous, or leave the reader feeling unsettled. I try out words that don't fit together, form phrases that defy linguistic conventions and break word flow. That's art, you know. That's an expression of my life.

On living: I hate the idea of becoming Another Asian American Engineer. Or, heaven forbid, another Asian American Ministry Worker. So let's not do either.

But what DO I want to be, and how do I move forward in achieving this? In my desire to expose everything that was fake and not of any truth, I forgot that I was tearing down the very structures that were designed to give me direction.

It connected yesterday afternoon, having an early dinner with pastor Peter back home. I had complained about not wanting to fall into the formula of those who had gone before me.

He just laughed. "You're going through your rebellious stage, Andrew."

Oh naw. Me? Heck naw.

But the more I thought about it, the more I realized yeah, I was totally rebelling and more so, trying to forge a path that was defined by what it **wasn't**. Too bad it forgot to try to discover what it **is**.

A son. A child. An object of affection for the most High?

Good ol' Postmodernism, how I love thee and your ugly ways of ruining my identity.

(I'm not done, I just don't know what more to write)

Went to BCM's Sunday Night Live performance last night, and there was few rows of us Asian kids not quite knowing whether to dance and where to just give the prerequisite head bob. Gospel and Neo-soul is where it's at. Asian folks could never pull it off, which is why God gave it to black folks.

AHHHH! Sophomore group and beautiful sophomores. I'm going to miss you so. Thanks for blessing me this year.

"Remember him???before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well, and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it." -Ecc 12:6-7
