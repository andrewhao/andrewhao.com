D: u know hw can't b done
D: tonite
D: tonite is like official slack-off nite for everybody

true dat. true dat. only problem being that i've been having a slack-off week. i mean look at me. i'm POSTING for goodness sakes  :)

we at agape did this cookie thing at lunch today (even though it was so wet outside!) we basically sent groups of people out with big plates of cookies and just gave em out. hahaha the number one response was "what did you do to them?!" when we just offered em.. but overall i think we got a pretty good response. we just wanted to show some love - or maybe just a nice chocolate chip cookie - to some of the students on this campus and i hope people took it the right way.

on a completely different tangent, can you say "144 cookies for FIVE BUCKS?!" whoo!

i think i've made up my mind to stop posting about superficial and extraneous things.. cuz in the end when i look back on these postings these things arent gonna matter.

drove all around today.. picked up some christmas stuff and cards (writing cards is so time consuming, i realize). i know i wanna keep away from getting sucked into the christmas gift-giving trap.. but i do want to show people that i care so i figure some small gesture of appreciation is gonna be okay.

all right.. winter formal's tomorrow and there's a LOT of stuff to prep and plan for still.. okay okay back to work. really.
