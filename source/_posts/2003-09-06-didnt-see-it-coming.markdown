dr. pwu died this morning.

i don't know what was going through his head. i don't know what specific type of cancer he carried, or how long he had it. all i know was that when my mom told me it blew me away.

i'm not going to overdramatize anything.. i never knew him very well. but i did know that he went to our church. i also knew that he knew my parents personally. and that after each visit to his office, i'd get a sesame street toothbrush.

for the first half of my life dr. pwu was my family dentist.. i remember going to his office and having him always finding a cavity in my mouth or perhaps in the one or two visits when i wouldn't and he would flash me a triumphant smile. i never remember any visit that hurt.. no cut gums or painful drills or anything. seems like that part of my life was a haze but dr. pwu was a small but integral part of it.

"he's dead!" exclaimed my mother, standing there in the kitchen with my uncle.

"went to heaven" corrected my dad.

strange how much i saw him like my dad.. about the same age with the same soft voice and wisened attitude. but when he died... wow. _life is short._ they say he worked himself to death.. that he never saw the cancer coming until it was too great and too late. and i know that in the back of my mind that's something that's bothering my parents.

and how does his wife and children feel? that's so horrible.. oh gosh. at least it's not the end. not for dr. pwu.. you're in a better place now. take care, and thanks for the clean teeth.
