PEACE.

fail a final, then what? Your life goes on.

Hey, remember Me? I got it under control. Had it all planned out from the day you were born. Loved you just as much then as I do now. Relax.

LIFE IS SO TEMPORARY.
Another kid died at my high school today. This has been going on for several years, so much death. I know so many people that are having a hard time dealing with death this close and personal. Terrible.

RIP Kevin Lam.
