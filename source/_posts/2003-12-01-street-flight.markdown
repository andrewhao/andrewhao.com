We locked eyes as soon as I walked out onto the Tijuana street. I was an American newcomer to a foreign land. He was simply a street kid who spent his days running in the littered sidewalks. But as soon as the humid air first hit my face, we chanced upon each other's eyes.

He spotted me before I spotted him. I had just taken my first few breaths of the salty ocean air when he came running up, tattered t-shirt, faded corduroy pants and all. Flashing a disarming smile, he promptly gave me a roundhouse punch to the gut. I gasped for air, surprised at this introduction and recovering, returned his smile. I picked my new friend up and spun him around. _Como te llamas? _What's your name?

_Cristian._

And so it was. The morning sunrises plastered the city with gold. I would gasp in shock as the chilly morning air hit my face at the door and see him on the sidewalk, running figure eights or spinning in dizzy circles, around and around and around in the newborn light. His parents sold woven bracelets, and so Cristian did too, galloping down the sidewalk, two in each grimy hand thrust in the faces of passerbys. He spent his days running up and down the boulevards in imaginary flight, oblivious to everything but the wind.

We loved to fly. I would pull him up onto my back, take a few leaps and together we would soar. _Estamos volando? _I shouted. Are we flying? Back and forth we rushed down the colorful Tijuana sidewalk, past food vendors, decrepit trinket shops and bars savoring the thrill of flight and spinning in our own dizzy dance. Over the rushing wind and our shouts, I could barely make out his response. _Si, estoy volando!_

But the night cast strange shadows over us as I headed back to the hotel in the darkened veil of the night. I would catch a glimpse of him sitting in a stairwell, cross-legged, staring straight into the street watching double eyes of cars pass him by. I felt the night chill bite at my face and imperceptibly saw Cristian shiver a little, his body tucked in to retain heat. I needed to turn away and shut my eyes. His eyes were on me as I walked by, away from the cold, away from the night and away from his eyes.

And in my dreams, I would keep walking, trying to ind a place where I would no longer have to hear those joyful cries, see that ragged shirt and look into those pools of blue. His eyes were dazzlingly blue, pools of _something_ staring into mine. I shut my eyes and continued on, walking into the dawn of morning light and leaving him behind with clipped wings on a littered landscape.

He found me on my last day in his land, making his way through the crowds to me standing on the sidewalk. My stomach turned slightly, coils of shame rising there in my gut. He tugged at my arm, I looked down at him not wanting to see the boy I had abandoned.

Cristian understood. It was something about his eyes as they sparkled in the sun--I nearly missed their gleam. He reached for me, I looked up to admire the priceless sky and--_oof!--_found a fist in my stomach. He let out a whoop, and I couldn't hold back a laugh. Let's fly.

So we flew for the last time in the gold of that August morning, laughing loudly, spinning deliriously and speeding recklessly down that Tijuana boulevard. I held him just a little tighter that morning as we rose in flight above the golden sky. _Estamos volando? _I yelled back at him.

_Si_, he replied, grinning and a little dizzy from our flight. _Estoy volando!_
