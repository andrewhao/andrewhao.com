"They call me Asshole."
A pause.
"That's my nickname. But I turn it right back around at 'em. I turn it back around. Elohssa. E-L-O-H-S-S-A. Sounds almost like hello."
I try to figure him out, but you never can. Asking for his name proved as such.
"Get it? It's Asshole spelled backwards."
I try to empathize, but you never can. "Must be tough for you out here?"
He squints through thick framed round glasses. "Oh you bet." A sigh, and he turns to stare at me.

Me, I'm a little uncomfortable squatting there with him on a crowded Telegraph Avenue. Keep the conversation going, right, keep the conversation going. I blurt the first thing that comes to mind. "So do you have any family around?" Whoops, didn't come out the way I wanted it to. "I mean, are they living somewhere else? If they're still around, that is." That sounded like a loaded question. Was that a loaded question? What if what if what if.

"Oh yeah, they're all living in Fort Worth." He looks at me intently through those thick peephole glasses. His eyes don't seem to be coordinated; they go at different angles. He can probably see two different directions at once, sitting on a street corner like this. I'm afraid I've stared too long and try to look past him, grabbing for another thing to say. "How long you been out here?"

His gaze is still fixated on me. "Since 1989. It was actually better here before the Bush administration came in. That's when all the money dried up." This look comes over his face, like he's on fire. "Used to be money all over the place with the Democrats. then the Republicans came in." His double-directional eyes are wildly moving about, looking past me, around me and right on through me. Each eye follows a passerby. He rocks forward a little as if we had a secret, just between him and me.

My name is Asshole, and they're just saying hello.
