the alarm radio went off today: 6:30 exactly, light jazz music serenading my ears. plugged into the wall timer was the lamp, also designed to be triggered at the same time as the radio. and as my eyes opened to catch the clock screaming "6:55! get up cuz it's 6:55!!" at me, i remembered.

_oh yeah._ and i smiled. i think that feeling's priceless.. it can be unmatched and unrivaled.

wasted a good deal of today recoding this blog in preparation of the NEW one! woohoo! yeaaahh so i've reactivated the commenting system (it's real ugly right now) and i've coded "Next" and "Previous" link features at the bottom so casual readers can browse through with some more ease. plus it really looks like xanga.

i was straight-out dissed the other day. now normally i would have laughed and brushed it off and not let it affect me, but this time was different. the guy straight out put me down.. some uncalled-for criticism and the worst thing was he **didnt realize what he'd done**. man.. i dont remember ever getting mad in a situation like this but this time was different. **that really hurt.. **i kept telling myself to cool down.. just calm down..

so i sucked it up, laughed like usual and just waved it off. you know.. put on that facade of mine. but inside it hurt. a lot. this was over some small superficial matter.. and honestly i shouldn't have gotten that ticked. but its all good now.. i dont think you'll ever realize who you are but i've forgiven ya.. and i hope you dont do the same to other people.

but anyways on a happier note, mark your calendars guys! this blog is about to get a major revamping, so keep your eyes (and your mouses) peeled..
