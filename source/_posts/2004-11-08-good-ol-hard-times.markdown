so many blessings right now that if i were to try to count them on my fingers i'd be a biological mutant with too many fingers.

actually school is utter murder, namely in the area of math in which i'm being destroyed. i figure i've done my best, i got spanked, time to move on.

but what's so awesome are the people i keep meeting and the relationships that are developing that really show that God is in the details, He's into the little things and small coincidences that serve to remind me "hey, I'm here" and totally make life worth living for.
