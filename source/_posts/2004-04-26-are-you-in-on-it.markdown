i have officially overcommitted myself, again. i don't know my limits, what a foolio. i dont know what it is about me that can't ask for help. some sort of superman complex when in reality you're some pasty thin pimplefaced kid with your pants down below your knees. and you don't even know it.

help me. please. i can't do this on my own. and the worst part is that i'm afraid to ask for the help. i know, it's stupid.

i'm kind of scared next year.. because i feel like i've been holding things together by myself and i'm hoping things don't just fall apart when i'm gone. i know it sounds conceited, but i'm really worrying about this. i shouldn't have to, because the upcoming leaders should be trained in these sorts of things, but i haven't been training anybody  8O

God is doing something, he's calling up people to move. call it revival, call it what you want, but things are shifting and things are happening. it's gonna start when we unite and fast and pray. are you in on it? we gotta mobilize, we gotta pray, we  gotta prepare. when the word comes, we're gonna go. i can't shake the feeling, it's so strong. **something's happening. **sorry it's so fuzzy right now, talk to me and i'll try my best to explain it to you.
