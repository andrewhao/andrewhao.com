<div class="entry-content lettrine"><p>Thanks to the summer heat I am unable to sustain a train of thought for more than a few sentences. I present: an abridged version of what&rsquo;s been in my head and my heart.</p>

<hr />

<p>Every night I get home around 9:00PM, get some food into my stomach, do half of my homework and usually fall asleep on it (I tend to sleep on the floor because I find the uncomfortable position helps me wake earlier)</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve been dealing with a lot more stress and drain than I&rsquo;ve anticipated for this summer. It&rsquo;s somewhat simple; I just don&rsquo;t have enough time to do the things I&rsquo;ve slated myself to do.</p>

<p>I tend to overestimate my capabilities (particularly when making promises to Dave or the rest of the team). So my new rule of thumb is: when giving time estimates, take your expected time frame and multiply by two (or three, sometimes).</p>

<hr />

<p>My dad has always wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor. &ldquo;Do something that makes a difference in other people&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; he tells me (Of course, he is referring to upstanding lawyers, doctors, et. al.) I can sense a regret in his voice as he admits, &ldquo;I wish I was one.&rdquo; And with a mixed expression of pride and silent sadness he looks at me, waiting for me to answer. I have none, but tread in his wake. It was my choice to follow his path to become an engineer, I remind myself. But his plea to make my life count stays with me still.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think my problem with recurring sin is not a matter of approach or method, but a matter of valuation. How much is my obedience worth to God if I don&rsquo;t express it in my joy and delight in chosen obedience? And how do I delight in God if He isn&rsquo;t my most valued treasure? So I desperately want You, God, to be supremely valued in my heart over every squalid little desire. So when I fall into the freakin&#8217; death cycle of sin, I will know deeply that You are infinitely more satisfying and run back to you. Deeper than anything.</p>

<hr />

<p>I went to the Giants game last night with Steve, Sarah and her friends, where I felt like a complete Giants-fan poser (I basically don&rsquo;t follow baseball, and now at school sans newspaper, I am completely cut off from that sphere). But the team dominated the Padres (so completely) I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel the urge to call them &lsquo;my&rsquo; team (faker).</p>

<hr />

<p>Hey (hetero) guys: Say you&rsquo;re dropping by your friend&rsquo;s apartment and he answers the door in nothing but his boxers and invites you in like it ain&rsquo;t a thing. Biggie or no biggie? (Man, I should ask this question on FAQQLY)</p>

<hr />

<p>I need to pray. I need to abide. A whole lot more. I need to know my God intimately. This isn&rsquo;t something to be put on the to-do list or on the extra credit portion of the quiz, but an urgent murmur in my heart that I keep putting aside because to be honest, it&rsquo;s easy to fake. You do it, I tell my hesitating self, not because you can look holy or pat yourself on the back. You do it because it is your lifeline. You do it because nothing will complete you or satisfy you more. You do it because you need &ldquo;streams of living water&rdquo; to quench your cynical heart. You do it because you simply have faith it will be so.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to manage my budget and track expenses. It&rsquo;s pretty scary, I&rsquo;ve discovered, how quickly money can slip through your fingers (especially if you&rsquo;re keeping track!). Throw your hands in the air if you feel this.</p>

<hr />

<p>I get the realization every so often that what I cook could quite legitimately be deemed as &lsquo;disgusting&rsquo; (And if I wasn&rsquo;t so hungry and desperate, I&rsquo;d quit chewing).</p>

<hr />

<p>Sleeping early and waking early: a clear sign of adulthood (obviously I don&rsquo;t get it yet). And plus, it&rsquo;s just good for you. A goal worthy of accomplishment (says our friend Ben Franklin).</p>
