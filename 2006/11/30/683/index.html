<div class="entry-content lettrine"><p>Thank you, all of you. It was after large group maybe three weeks ago, when we all went to the Asian Ghetto to grab some grub. I spotted Mike at the corner and after talking for a bit, we went to get a chicken plate from Mandarin House (he hadn&rsquo;t eaten most for much of the day).</p>

<p>But he was staggering&mdash;looking distracted, unfocused and complaining of arm pains. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than it usually is,&rdquo; he told me. He couldn&rsquo;t eat as he was clenching his left forearm every couple of seconds or so.</p>

<p>I asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital. He had to pause and think for a few minutes&mdash;&ldquo;Naw, man, you got things to do tonight. I&rsquo;ll go later tonight.&rdquo; I had to insist.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s where I am thankful. I didn&rsquo;t have a car, but Justin was there in the court and went to get his car and drive. And the rest of you&mdash;a group of about six&mdash;just simply came walking out of the court and simply asked, &ldquo;Mike, can we pray for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That really moved me, guys. You all layed hands on him and prayed. And that moment I had a realization that this is the kingdom of God, coming down to earth at this moment. We were praying&mdash;Mike, you, me&mdash;; with simple faith &amp; in the able healing hands of our Father.</p>

<p>Justin pulls up and we head off to Highland Hospital. Mike heads straight into the ER (the staff know him there) and we head home.</p>

<p>I found Mike the next day. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d given me the wrong medication last time, Drew,&rdquo; he tells me. &ldquo;They forgot my iron pills.&rdquo; He shows me the papers. &ldquo;They renewed my Medicare too. My prescription&rsquo;s good for another six months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friends showed me love last night, Drew. Kept me going.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Fast forward three weeks to tonight, and I see Mike again on the street (only this time I&rsquo;m a little ashamed to approach him &mdash; the past three weeks I&rsquo;ve been too busy to see him). He eyes me (I suppose he&rsquo;s trying to make out my face in the darkness) and we slap palms. &ldquo;How you doin&#8217;, Drew? How was your Thanksgiving?&rdquo; I mumble some sort of excuse.</p>

<p>Mike gets excited, his voice rising and quickening. &ldquo;There was this guy messin&#8217; the place up last night. Big guy, young.&rdquo; Mike is gesturing at his shoulders, indicating the breadth of this man&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;A Cal student. He came in here six o&#8217;clock in the morning on Monday and starting kicking things over. Tables, trays, everything, making a mess. He went in that place&mdash;(gesturing at the Yokohama Station restaurant)&mdash;messed up the place then went to the next place and started kicking things over too. Tried to take out a window or two. I heard about it and came out here the next day at 6AM and waited for him. He didn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike sits down on an overturned paint can, pulls his hood tighter over his head and continues:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday he comes back again, 12:30 noon when everybody&rsquo;s here. He walks back into Yokohama Station and starts beating up the Chinese guy and his wife. You could here it from way out here, &lsquo;stop it! stop it!&rsquo;. I run in there and go &lsquo;hey what you doin&rsquo; man?&lsquo; The guy&rsquo;s throwing around chairs and tea cups and salt and pepper shakers. He&rsquo;s socking the Chinese guy in the face, and everybody&rsquo;s screaming from way out here.&rdquo; Mike stands up and acts it out: &ldquo;I throw the guy down&mdash;boom!&mdash;and he&rsquo;s down and he tries to get up again, so I pull his legs out from under him and the Chinese guy and me, we hold him down. I look him in the face and I recognize him &mdash; he used to come and put change in my cup. Tell him &#8216;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pick up my jaw from the floor. &ldquo;That happened yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, yesterday. Now everybody loves me. They tell me, &lsquo;you did a good thing, Mike.&rsquo; Cops take the guy to jail&mdash;tell me he say he&rsquo;ll be back. But whoo, everybody loves me now. The lady make me some broccoli beef yesterday and tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know what &mdash; I got approved for disability&mdash;they tell me to just wait a while, be patient, but it&rsquo;s coming. I don&rsquo;t need a lawyer no more. Got a bunch of people ahead of me in line, but that check be coming soon. Gonna get me off these streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mumble something like a &ldquo;wow.&rdquo; Cuz I&rsquo;m seriously amazed. God, you&rsquo;re providing. You&rsquo;re doing it. Wow.</p>

<hr />

<p>(Does anybody have a pair of men&rsquo;s gloves? Mike&rsquo;s asked for a pair cuz it gets cold at night. Let me know if you have one, thanks)</p>
