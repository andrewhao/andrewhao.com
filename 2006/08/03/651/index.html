<ol type="a">
<li>ï¿½If you gather to preach illegally, we will confiscate your house!ï¿½</li>
</ol>


<p>One
Sunday morning before Easter 2006, six officials from the Religion
Department of Wendeng, Shandong Province came to the worship room of a
family church in Bukou Village, Bokou Port Management Committee, where
many Christians were in attendance. A Director General and a Department
Director of the Religion Department of Wendeng interrupted our meeting,
and asked Tian Yinghua, the preacher of the family church, to go to a
back room. At the same time, without permission, the officials opened
the donation box and checked the amount of money in it. To their
disappointment they only found RMB?20.00! Thus, they left the money in
the box and went away.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Director General
and the Department Director of the Religion Department of Wendeng
started to interrogate Tian Yinghua:</p>

<p>Official: You Christians should not lie.</p>

<p>Tian:
God said, ï¿½Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No, anything more than
this comes from the evil one.ï¿½ I have answered your question, we
Christians do not lie.</p>

<p>Official: The Religion Department has been here several times, you know?</p>

<p>Tian: I know.</p>

<p>Official: This is an illegal meeting, an illegal breach.</p>

<p>Tian:
We have not broken any laws, Article 36 of the Constitution of the PRC
states that ï¿½citizens enjoy the right to believe in any religion.ï¿½</p>

<p>Official:
We regulate attendance and there cannot be more than 30 people present,
and they are limited to relatives, did you know that?</p>

<p>Tian: Document No. 145 on religion states that ï¿½relatives and friends can join family religious meetings.ï¿½</p>

<p>Official: No, family meetings are limited to 30 people, if there are more, you have to register.</p>

<p>Tian:
Document No. 145 on religion states that ï¿½family meetings do not need
to register,ï¿½ if necessary, please register for us now.</p>

<p>Official: No way, go to the ï¿½Three-Selfï¿½ to register.</p>

<p>Tian:
Your words contradict yourself. You said that citizens enjoyed the
freedom to believe in any religion, when in fact we have no freedom.</p>

<p>Official: What do you think of ï¿½Three-Selfï¿½ church?</p>

<p>Tian:
The preachers of ï¿½Three-Selfï¿½ are jealous, they argue and are cliquish.
Wang Xinfeng and Zhang Jianjun fought for power. I donï¿½t think they are
the son of God, so I left.</p>

<p>Official: If you gather illegally, we will confiscate the house where you meet.</p>

<p>Then
the Director General rigorously said, ï¿½Was your house was built with
your own money or otherï¿½s money? Youï¿½d better have proof, otherwise we
will confiscate it.ï¿½</p>

<p>Tian Yinghua sternly answered, ï¿½If you
quote policy, I will listen. But you have come to bully us. I withdrew
money from the bank to build this house, the bank did not give me a
note, and how can I prove it? You said if I had no money to build a
house, you would take it away, what is your proof? Does the law
regulate in this way?ï¿½</p>

<p>The Director General and Department
Director couldnï¿½t answer and hurried away. Before they left, they
required Tian Yinghua to sign a note stating that they were holding an
Illegal get-together and illegal preaching. Tian Yinghua refused to do
so. After they left, Sunday Worship Service continued.</p>

<p>II. ï¿½If you donï¿½t stop worshipping, we will send you to reeducation through labor.ï¿½</p>

<p>At
9:40 AM, Jun 11, 2006, Hou Chengxun, the head of the Domestic Security
Protection Squad of Wendeng Public Security Bureau in Shandong and the
head of the Fifth Squad; Cong Peiqing, the head of Public Security
Squad; The Director General and a Department Director (the two officers
who once came here before Easter), led more than 50 policemen in 10
police wagons to our family church at Bukou Village, Bukou Port
Management Committee, Wendeng, and besieged the nearly 60 Christians.
They barricaded each door of the house, forbidding them to leave and
shouted into the microphone, ï¿½Stand still, get in a wagon.ï¿½ While
shouting, they continued taking photos and recording the meeting and
Christians, forbidding them to speak. If someone said, ï¿½Free belief,ï¿½
the police would cry out, ï¿½Take him/her away!ï¿½ Two believers, Liu Yujie
and Zhang Shuzheng are over 60 years old; several strong men dragged
them into a police wagon with their arms pinned backward, just like
criticizing the four categories of people during the Culture
Revolution.</p>

<p>To our surprise, as agents of national organs,
none of them showed their identifications to the Christians in
compliance with the law, not even a summons paper. Without giving them
any chance to legally defend themselves, they took these Christians to
Bukou Police Station of the Public Security Bureau of Wendeng, ignoring
their protests, where each Christian was imprisoned and interrogated in
individual rooms. This time, the Public Security Bureau of Wendeng
caught 31 Christians, the rest escaped in the chaos.</p>

<p>June 29,
2006, I met Tian Yinghua, Wang Qiu, and Jiang Rong who were just
released from prison at the chapel of Bukou family church.</p>

<p>Tian
Yinghua recalled it was Hou Chengxun, the head of Domestic Security
Protection Squad, the head of the Fifth Squad, and Cong Peiqing, the
head of Public Security Squad of the Public Security Bureau of Wendeng
who interrogated her. They clearly threatened Tian Yinghua, the
preacher, ï¿½If you still preach at the next meeting, we will sentence
you to prison, send you to Qingdao Reform School and reeducate you for
three years.ï¿½ Following is dialogue between Tian Yinghua and the
Police:</p>

<p>Police: When did you begin to believe in God?</p>

<p>Tian: 14 years ago (1992).</p>

<p>Police: Can you cure any disease?</p>

<p>Tian: I cannot. I prayed to Jesus to cure me. Before I suffered terminal breast cancer, it was Jesus who cured my disease.ï¿½</p>

<p>Police: You called up all the people?</p>

<p>Tian:
No. We welcome everyone, you also can come, when everybody believes in
Jesus society will be stable, nobody will steal, rob or do evil.</p>

<p>Police: What about the house in which you gather?</p>

<p>Tian:
It is Sister Wang Qiuï¿½s house. She borrowed money from me to send her
son abroad, and allowed me to live in her house. She will repay me
after her son comes back, if she cannot afford the money he will give
me her house.</p>

<p>Police: You gather and preach illegally. If you continue, we will sentence you to three years imprisonment.</p>

<p>Tian: Citizens enjoy the right to believe in any religion, I have not breached any law.</p>

<p>Following is the dialogue between Zhang Shuzheng, a 72-year-old Christian and the</p>

<p>Police: Why do you believe in God?</p>

<p>Zhang: I am a stomach cancer patient and once went through an operation to remove my left kidney.</p>

<p>The Police interrupted him: When did you start?</p>

<p>Zhang: 1993.</p>

<p>Police: How did you begin? Who told you to believe?</p>

<p>Zhang:
A sister told me to believe. At that time I did not believe what she
said, but just wanted to try. After I joined the church, I recovered
gradually, and never took any medicine. So I cannot live without Jesus
now.</p>

<p>Police: How much have you given to the church.</p>

<p>Zhang: We live in the countryside, different from cities; we are supported by our children and have no money.</p>

<p>Police: Why donï¿½t you go to ï¿½Three-Self?ï¿½</p>

<p>Zhang:
We cannot go there, it is managed by the Government, and there is
disagreement and cliques. We shall follow the instruction in Holy
Bible, so we cannot go there.</p>

<p>Following is the dialogue between Shi Shushuang (female, 74-years-old, became a believer in June 2005) and the Police:</p>

<p>Police: Auntie, how did you believe in Jesus?</p>

<p>Shi:
I believe in God because God is kind. I knew about it from the age of 8
years. At that time, a British missionary worked here. Last year
someone told me to come here, I feel I am late.</p>

<p>Police: Where did you buy the Bible?</p>

<p>Shi: I bought it from Nanjing, you can buy them there, there are many.</p>

<p>Police: Auntie, how much have you given the church?</p>

<p>Shi: I do not have any income, completely depending on my children, how can I have money?</p>

<p>At
the moment, Shi Shushuang questioned the Police, ï¿½What law did I
violate by believing in God? You treat us this way, not letting me to
go to the restroom, if you broke the law, would you be treated like
this?</p>

<p>Police: Auntie, you can not talk this way for you are a Christian.</p>

<p>Shi: I will talk to you this way, but I will not talk this way in front of Jesus.</p>

<p>Police: Auntie, you should believe in God in your heart.</p>

<p>Shi:
I believe in my heart &ndash; not my mouth. I am illiterate and when I come
across something I donï¿½t understand in the Bible I certainly ask a
brother or sister.</p>

<p>Following is the dialogue between
Christianï¿½Cui Yingshun (female, 41-years-old, Korean National, original
place is Jilin) and the Police:</p>

<p>Police: How long have you believed in God?</p>

<p>Cui: More than 10 years.</p>

<p>Police: How long have you been in Shandong?</p>

<p>Cui: About 10 years.</p>

<p>Police:
Did you believe when you were in the northeast? How did you get to know
the church after you came here? Who led you to the church?</p>

<p>Cui: I went there by myself, nobody told me.</p>

<p>Police: What did you do in the church?</p>

<p>Cui: We sang hymns, read scriptures, and prayed.</p>

<p>Police: Who is the head?</p>

<p>Cui: We donï¿½t have a head, everybody is equal.</p>

<p>Police: Your church believes in God, is it because you can cure disease there?</p>

<p>Cui: As for me, it can, otherï¿½s belief, I donï¿½t quite understand.</p>

<p>Police: Can you not to go to church?</p>

<p>Cui: No, I feel bad if I donï¿½t go there.</p>

<p>Police: When do you usually meet?</p>

<p>Cui: On Wednesday and Sunday in the northeast and here on Sunday.</p>

<p>Police: You cannot gather anymore.</p>

<p>Cui: It is impossible, even if you send me to prison, I will go to service.</p>

<p>Police: What is Sister Tianï¿½s name?</p>

<p>Cui: I donï¿½t know.</p>

<p>Police: You are so stubborn, I will not talk to you anymore, later those from the Religion Department will talk with you.</p>

<p>Just
as Cui Yingshun wanted to say something, the Police stopped her, ï¿½Go,
go!ï¿½ and pushed her out the door. After the Police interrogated the 31
Christians, required them to sign and fingerprint the record, they took
them into a room. Then the Director General and Department Director of
Religion Department of Wendeng appeared. Each of them took a
black-covered booklet, on which were printed and hand-written words.</p>

<p>Then
the Department Director began to teach us. His words were full of
ï¿½sympathy.ï¿½ ï¿½You live hard lives, finding it difficult to buy matches
and salt, but the money you donate to the church is unsecured. Never
let some ill-motivated person fool you. If you give money to Three-Self
church, we will secure it.ï¿½ Then the Department Director recited
religious policy according to the booklet, ï¿½Citizens enjoy the right to
believe in any religion, but do not enjoy the right to choose the
place. In the event of any further illegal meetings, we will publicly
sell the house used for the meeting.ï¿½</p>

<p>Having finished his
lesson, he told us to return home. Tian Yinghua went to Director
General of the Religion Department and to reason with him. Tin Yinghua
said, ï¿½I want to say something to clarify the truth. Why do leaders of
the Religion Department and the Public Security Bureau talk
differently? Last time, the Religion Department said a 30-person
meeting was permitted, but this time the Public Security Bureau said
even one person couldnï¿½t meet, they could only believe in God at home,
who is telling the truth?</p>

<p>The head of Public Security Squad fiercely told Tian, ï¿½Donï¿½t gab here, go back home.ï¿½</p>

<p>Sister Wang Qiu said, ï¿½You brought us here by police wagon, you should send the older sisters and brothers back.ï¿½</p>

<p>Tian said, ï¿½You should resume our reputation.ï¿½</p>

<p>Hou
Chengxun, the head of Domestic Security Protection Squad of the Public
Security Bureau of Wendeng, said, ï¿½Ok, send them back.ï¿½</p>

<p>The
head of the Fifth Squad said, ï¿½Ok, come on, I will send you back one by
one.ï¿½ The policemen agreed to take the ones who get in their police
wagon. In the courtyard of Bukou Police Station, the Policemen began to
drag people into their wagon. Several policemen grabbed female
Christian, Wang Qiuï¿½s arms and dragged her into the wagon in handcuffs
where they used electric batons and Wang Qiuï¿½s mouth bled, and blood
blisters appeared on her arms. Sister Jiang Rong, a Christian,
challenged the policemen by asking them why they beat others, the
policeman took her into the wagon without a word, and send them to
prison. Then, six policemen forced Tian Yinghua, the preacher, into a
police wagon. Tian Yinghuaï¿½s older sister, Tian Aihua, and her younger
brother, Tian Hongxu, are not Christians but witnessed the scene.</p>

<p>Afterwards
Tian Yinghua recalled that her sister and brother had gone to the Bukou
Police Station for answers and saw Tian Yinghua caught by the police.
Then Tian Yinghua saw her brother being pressed to the ground by four
or five policemen twisting his arms. When Tianï¿½s sister walked forward
the police grabbed her arms and she cried, ï¿½Today is my motherï¿½s 80th
birthday? Does your mother celebrate her birthday? Does your mother
like to celebrate her birthday in this way? My sister is a kind woman,
she believes in God, I know she does not do evil, this is her belief,
and she has to cure herself.ï¿½ Tian Yinghua said that her heart was
broken at the sight of this scene. But her mind was calm, continuing to
pray, she knew it was God who was comforting her. After her prayer she
told her mother, sister, and brother not to be sad.</p>

<p>That day the Police sentenced Tian Yinghua, Wang Qiu and Jiang Rong to 10-days detention for ï¿½illegally meeting and preaching.ï¿½</p>

<p>III. Policemen in Wendeng Prison: ï¿½You are not a Christian, you are a cult follower.ï¿½</p>

<p>Tian
Yinghua told me on the way to the prison, that the head of the Public
Security Squad of the Public Security Bureau of Wendeng said to her,
ï¿½Listen, Tian Yinghua, donï¿½t you understand? We want to send you back
home to celebrate your motherï¿½s 80th birthday and arrest you tomorrow.
You can even take the police wagon and keep your reputation. Then we
have to send you into prison today, to see whether you still want to
take our wagon, and keep your reputation. ï¿½ Having arrived at the
prison, policewoman Liu asked why she was detained. Tian answered,
ï¿½Because I believe in God.ï¿½</p>

<p>The policewomen said, ï¿½You talk
nonsense, policeman never arrest Christians, you must have disturbed
the social order under the guise of Christianity, this is a cult, a
Falun Gong Cult, Christians should go to the ï¿½Three-Selfï¿½ church to
worship.ï¿½ Then other policemen followed and said that Tian Yinghua,
Wang Qiu and Jiang Rong did not believe in God, but in a cult.</p>

<p>After
detention, Tian Yinghuaï¿½s second older brother went to pick up Tian
Yinghua at the prison. He asked the head of the Fifth Squad of the
Public Security Bureau of Wendeng why they always arrested Christian
believers who are mainly old people and women. The head of the Fifth
Squad said that Wendeng Religion Department went to the family church
in Bukou several times, there were dozens of people the first time,
about forty or fifty the second time, there were more than 60 people
the third time. At that time I had told Tian Yinghua it was an illegal
gathering and told them to stop, if not we would confiscate their house
and property. These Christians would not listen and continued to meet.
We werre afraid it was cultic activity under the guise of Christianity,
intending to overthrow the Government as Sanban Puren and Dongfang
Shandian, so we forbad their gathering.</p>

<p>The day when Tian
Yinghua left the prison, the head of the Fifth Squad warned Tian again,
ï¿½In the event that another meeting was raided, it would not be
detention. Next time it will be Weihai Police who arrests you, and they
will send you into Qingdao Reform School.ï¿½ Tian Yinghua, confused after
hearing his threats, said, ï¿½I know our country respects law and human
rights, but now I have lost the freedom to meet other Christians. I
have not broken any national law, only because I believe in God.</p>

<p>Then
what will be the result when caught next time? Will Tian Yinghua really
be sent to Qingdao Reform School like the head of the Fifth Squad said?</p>

<p>June
30, 2006, I, as the agent of Tian Yinghua, Wang Qiu and Jiang Rong,
proposed administrative reconsideration to Wendeng Municipal Government
on the administrative punishment by the Public Security Bureau of
Wendeng. I believe a legal battle to defend freedom of belief will
follow. The process may be long, but no matter whether it is a success
or a failure, it will be learning experience for legal executors.</p>
