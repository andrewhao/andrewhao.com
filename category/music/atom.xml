    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the recent theme of grace, maybe one of the reasons I really like country songs and the myths they tell is because you can feel the grit in the stories. Country protagonists live out their flaws fully (for better or worse) but there&rsquo;s always that redemptive thread.</p>

<p>Or maybe I just want to drive a pickup truck.</p>

<p>Onward:</p>

<p>A question worth exploring is: how does my identity as an Asian-American man affect my perception of grace (and my fascination with southern white culture)? Is it self-aware irony, a hipster thing? Does it say something about the dominant culture I live in? Does it reflect on my own view of Asian masculinity (or lack thereof)?</p>

<p>Topics for future discussion, but honestly, I do really just want a pickup truck.</p>
