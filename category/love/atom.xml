    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year!</p>

<p>Last night I spent a good amount of time looking back at my journal and saw a few threads that ran through last year:</p>

<p>If 2011 was a year of risk-taking, then 2012, I&rsquo;ve summed up, was a building year, a year to build a rhythm and establish a flow. It was a full year at Blurb, commuting back and forth from SF. Keeping up the same routine at Regen. Stephen Ministry on Mondays, Circuit training Tuesdays, Wednesday mornings with Jeff, home group on Thursdays, Saturday morning runs, Sundays with Betty. Routine and rhythm. It can be good for you.</p>

<p>Knowing who I am, building a flow can be something to settle into but the risk is that I can get too comfortable.  But I found myself up against the reality that your ideals often have a hard time matching up to your reality. So on a serious note, last year was also the first year that I felt like I was just&hellip; <em>coasting</em>. And it felt horrible, the thought and feeling that the kind of life I should have been living should be filled with more risk, more Jesus + his presence. I&rsquo;m learning that I can oftentimes fall into routine and forget myself and why I&rsquo;m here.</p>

<p>There was a season &mdash; I remember it well &mdash; last year when I sat down and wrote down everything I was feeling &mdash; frustration with my life, honest doubts about my purpose and my faith and a slew of questions for God or Jesus or whoever it was that was overseeing my life. Life in Christ is filled with <em>joy</em>, right? Then why wasn&rsquo;t I feeling it? I was tempted to give it all up again.</p>

<p>The intersection of your faith and your daily life can disconnect sometimes, and things had derailed for a long time before I noticed it. The cynicism was subtle, but would crawl into things and inner dialogues. It would rebel against pat answers I saw people giving around me, or the cultural disconnects I&rsquo;d see between the church and Real Life, and a broken world.</p>

<p>The burnout was palpable, but here&rsquo;s the thing: it was something that I didn&rsquo;t do anything about. I kept up the same routines, held the same smiles and had the same answers. But inside there was a gnawing question that reappears from time to time: what is real about my life? Where was that sense that the world is on the brink of something glorious that I felt so often when I was younger&mdash;when things had a surety about them, and answers were more black and white, and joy was real because you were laughing, too? What about the intersection of dirt &amp; the divine, miracles I used to see, or evidence of the supernatural? Where does that stuff just <em>go</em> when you&rsquo;ve lived without them for so long?</p>

<p>Talking to Jeff, I was reminded that the times I felt <em>alive</em> in Christ were the times I was taking risks. So a lot of last year was about asking myself &mdash; where am I going? Where are places I can grow and risks that I can take? And there were a few themes: living in Oakland, identifying with the broken, friendships and brothers, youth &amp; community, silence &amp; solitude.</p>

<p>To be honest, a lot of that has not materialized, and a lot of that were gushy ideas lacking structure and thought and a strong heart.</p>

<p>God, I want that for this year. I want more faith, more experiences of your grace. I want courage to fight for people I love and defend the things I believe in (and vice versa). I want to run toward conflict instead of away from it. I want a stronger, more compassionate heart, and I want to run with people that show that too. But I mainly want to sense your nearness and know you with the familiarity of a son.</p>

    <updated>2012-01-23T10:04:35-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/01/23/gong-gong-puo-puo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My grandfather (ah gong, or 外公, but we call him gong gong), driven by winds of Communist change, arrived in Taiwan in the 1940s. He was a Fuzhou businessman, 26 at the time. He was a businessman, relatively wealthy and educated, and fled from the incoming Communists.</p>

<p>He met my grandmother (ah ma, or 外媽 &mdash; but we&rsquo;ve grown up calling her puo puo) while they both worked as schoolteachers at the same elementary school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ah gong was a handsome man&rdquo; my grandmother says with a chuckle and a glimmer in her eye. She is dignified, ladylike, and precise. She bears eyes with depth, holding her teacup with deliberate old-world delicacy. My early memories are sprinkled with her constant presence in our house, making fantastic food and reading me chinese fables for bedtime stories.</p>

<p>They met in the years in between the world wars, when the world was changing. My grandma was native Taiwanese, telling me about the world she grew up in, hearing American bombers fly overhead, when alarms would sound and they would have to head to the mountains to hide in the hills. Taiwan was different then, they were raised to believe they were Japanese.</p>

<p>They fell in love, but they don&rsquo;t speak much about it nowadays. I wonder how it was back then. She was trained as a schoolteacher, and he must have been good with the kids given his gregarious charm. It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine why they fell in love, but how? I wonder if they can still remember.</p>

<p>These days, they live in Taipei in a modern apartment, paneled in marble and dark wood. His hands tremble when they reach for the dishes on the table. She reaches for the dish and steadies it for him. After each meal he silently shuffles to the couch and picks his teeth with a toothpick and looks out the window at the glassy beams of the Taipei 101 tower.</p>

<p>Her family would have nothing to do with him. He was an outsider, one of the KMT occupiers. Stories ran rampant about KMT men looking for Taiwanese wives while keeping a wife back in China. What did my great-grandfather think of him? Did they ever meet? Or did he forbid their love from the outside?</p>

<p>So they eloped.</p>

<p>Annie asks if puo-puo gets tired of cooking for us. My dad laughs. &ldquo;I bet she loves it that we&rsquo;re here. She loves to cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spread is enormous. Taro fish ball soup, fresh steamed fish from the market, boiled chicken, dumplings, radish salad, an array of steamed vegetables and guavas and wax apples for dessert. We lay there after each meal, stunned and deliriously happy.</p>

<p>My mom would tell me about how in the years down the road after their marriage, gong-gong would eventually win over my grandmother&rsquo;s family with his kindness, generosity, and charm and twinkle in his eye. I wonder what it was like, a slow, gradual warming, a reconciliation that may have taken years to mend.</p>

<p>My uncle calls us when we&rsquo;re there, asking if they want to come with them on their upcoming vacation to Japan. Puo-puo hesitates, smiling a bit, thinking. When she is thinking, she knits her brow and blinks slowly. It&rsquo;s her reserved nature that defines her elegance, I decide. But she is like a wall, difficult to read. I want to ask her about her young love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she finally says, &ldquo;I should stay here. It&rsquo;s cold in Japan. And I need to be with your dad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later as we sit around the living room sharing our hopes for the new year (my dad puts us through these things) gong-gong makes an innocent face and tells us that his hope is that &ldquo;your puo-puo should visit Japan and get out of the house and not have to take care of me.&rdquo; She smiles.</p>

<p>Gong-gong is always dressed well: suede jackets, pressed wool, a sleek Kangol cap and shiny loafers. These days, he&rsquo;s still dapper but much less mobile. His walk is reduced to a shuffle.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s shrunk over the years, but his charm is still there, shrouded by ailing health. As we leave, he grabs my arm and tells me he&rsquo;d like to attend my wedding soon and leaves me a kiss on the neck.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the days when the weather is right, I swear I can feel the tickle of young love: the kind that’s radiant, inviting, and easy to fall into. It’s simple and charming and as light as goosefeathers.</p>

<p>On some odd days, I can vaguely remember the approach to the precipice of old love, woolen, worn &amp; monumental. We knew we were on the verge of crossing, but never sure how to look over to the other side. Young love is easy, I realize, but old love is not.</p>

<p>Old love is familiar yet ill-fitting, like bumping shoulders with strangers in elevators. You never notice it arriving, and when it has, it’s morphed. The taste changes in your mouth; the notes go all blue and glassy like black piano keys.</p>

<p>I tried to hold her loneliness once, balancing it between both palms and guessing at its secrets. Like most notebooks go, it was silent and weighty and important. We bound it back up quickly, leaving crinkles in the seams. Sometimes I still wonder if I could have borne its weight.</p>

<p>Looking back, it was my embarrassment that caught me off guard. Nobody told me about it, a bottled-up outside-in feeling, a silly and shameful confusion. I felt childlike, at a loss of answers, wanting to hide. This I’ve learnt, too: I must run quickly to the father, before my armor thickens.</p>

<p><em>Yahweh is my father</em> I heard someone once cry, and I will do the same. He has gifted us a hundred sadnesses for our good, and we will soon (soon) sing songs in firelight and know again the barely-floating sensations of joy. He is the one who has ordained for us the seasons. I will yield to his grip and submit to his kiln. <em>Stay low to the ground</em> I heard once, and felt it True.</p>

<p>I smelled it coming last week, but it didn&rsquo;t arrive until today. It smelled like autumn, it was warm rain, ticklish; it was musty with diamond dew and faded memories of running through these trees at our old church camp site, redwood trees tickling the clouds and the sweet fragrance of pine cones and the pricks of needles in my shoes. That&rsquo;s the kind of place where the mist envelops your eyes and causes you to blink, over and over and over again. Memories of the bell ringing on the steeple, calling us in for dinner as we would push past adults with understanding smiles to get to turkey and gravy and pumpkin pie, stuffing ourselves and running back out into the wild, pretending we were secret agents.</p>

<p>But there it was again in a different form, carrying us back from LA through the fertile fields of the Central Valley, sunlight streaking over our heads and we drove back and debated whether we were old or not. That previous night at the wedding I asked my table if they&rsquo;d ever really felt <em>old</em>, and that maybe the better question was whether we ever wished we were <em>young</em> again. We all laughed it off, or at least a bit nervously. I wonder if there&rsquo;s a slight terror to the feeling of it overcoming us, afraid that maybe one day we&rsquo;d wake up and feel some gloom of extra gravity and it&rsquo;d hit us: <em>oh crap </em>and we&rsquo;d carry this fear to our twenty-fifth year high school reunions, strung &lsquo;round our necks like medallions. But there rushing past sunkissed fields listening to country crooners I wondered if I&rsquo;d ever really grow old, with the sun on my back and laughter, sweet laughter around me.</p>

<p>I think the warmth of autumn reminds me that all things must change, they must grow and move in season. One day I know I must be old, and I will have known a love that is young and weathered, resilient and yielding and tested True. I will have known the courage of a little boy, spoken to the weighty fears of my young man self, into the maturity that awaits on the other side, the line that we will not know we have crossed until the leaves have long since changed their color.</p>

    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2011/06/10/on-listening-to-betty</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/5769226387/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5769226387_4cd938676c.jpg" alt="Betty" /></a></p>

<p>The most difficult (and yet I suspect one of the most rewarding) part of this year&rsquo;s internship has been to simply sit with somebody and listen. Yes, it&rsquo;s been maddeningly difficult with Betty, the lady pictured above.</p>

<p>Ask anybody; I&rsquo;m a busy, hyper-scheduled guy. But to listen to someone is to really allow yourself to be inconvenienced. To let them stop you in the middle of a busy hall and hear them out, to let someone know that their ramblings about the most inane things really <em>matter</em> to you can really communicate care.</p>

<p>But how many people in our American culture really care to listen to one another? Or are we always running place to place, never stopping long enough to talk and hear each other out? Perhaps we&rsquo;re too busy shouting over each other.</p>

<p>More often than not, I&rsquo;m half-listening to Betty and half-plotting my escape from the conversation (she is masterful at grabbing for your ear and not letting go). But what if, as Carol Johnston once told us, we decided to listen, <em>really listen</em> with undivided attention, until the other person has nothing left to say?</p>

<p>Betty and I have this love-hate relationship. I think she fights with me more than any other person. &ldquo;I feel like you just want to dump me off at my place, like a piece of trash&rdquo; she snarled at me one week. I was so pissed. But it&rsquo;s true; when I talk to her I dream of not talking to her. I don&rsquo;t value her opinions like I would a friend&rsquo;s. (And she smells).</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve been challenged to listen to her and see past her toxicity and defenses. Love can cover a multitude of (my obnoxious) sins. I sat down with her one afternoon and did my best to hear her out for an hour. She was so pleasant that it scared me. People are saying that she&rsquo;s changing. Maybe it&rsquo;s because some people in my community are really making an effort to sit down with her, share a meal, give a ride, and lend an ear.</p>
