    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh my God, I&rsquo;m cold. I guess I didn&rsquo;t imagine this on my retreat.
30MPH gusts blowing at me, stinging my face with snow bits. Nature is beautiful yet harsh, and I
realize that the City Boy in me is not quite cut out for this. We aren&rsquo;t
in Oakland any more.</p>

<p>Nobody is on this snow-covered trail. I am following moose tracks some ways in the
distance. I imagine it ambling toward me, at some earlier point in the
morning. Is it a moose? Or a horse? Paw prints emerge in the snow a bit
further on, and I wonder if there are mountain lions nearby.</p>

<p>That morning I drove up to Lake Brainard and was met with blasting winds
coming over the mountain pass. I changed my mind, <em>screw this</em>, and I
jumped back into the car and drove a few miles down the road, figuring
that I&rsquo;d take a couple of miles of hiking in the forest to warm up before navigating through the lower lake.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/15438591602"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5601/15438591602_eb9f37844c_b.jpg" alt="Lake Isabelle" /></a></p>

<p>Three hours and a mere six miles later, I&rsquo;m at
Lake Isabelle, a frosty, glassy-blued alpine lake, and the sun has just
begun to warm me. Alas, the gusts are still there. I see two men make
their way up on the trail pass above, their voices echoing off the
mountain walls. The snow somehow makes their voices travel further, or
I&rsquo;m really desperate for human contact.</p>

<p>I think of all the hikes I&rsquo;ve taken with friends in the past and for a
moment, desperately wish they were here, just so I could stop feeling so
lonely, or to have some conversation to keep my mind turning.</p>

<p>Annie asked me the other day
what I think about when I&rsquo;m running. Sometimes I&rsquo;m singing a song in my
head, or other times I&rsquo;m just picturing me entering the next trail. At
the moment, I&rsquo;m envisioning how warm the car is and how good the bed is
going to feel. I&rsquo;ve been turning over a phrase in my head for the past
couple of days: &ldquo;A new way to be human.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a line from a Switchfoot
song, and I have a suspicion that it has some significance for me here.</p>

<p>I meet more
backpackers coming back the other way: <em>High winds, no visibility, we&rsquo;re
turning around</em>. I make mental notes to go as far as I can, and realize
that honestly, I have no idea how I will know. Is it fear? Is it
physical tiredness?</p>

<p>In the end, I turn around because I&rsquo;m cold.</p>

<p>The clouds are getting
darker and the gusts are biting more fiercely. I arrive at a snowy field at 12000 feet and look up. The
next climb is totally shrouded in a dark cloud. Two men are hurriedly
making their way down from the top. I shiver. Let&rsquo;s go home.</p>

<p>This solo retreat is exactly rooting
out the things I want and love. I desire the warmth of friendship, the
experience of beauty, the purpose of a journey. I did come here to be
alone, but I did also come here to find a new way to move and be human.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Push and pull, move and wait. I&rsquo;m in a season of waiting, of settling down. One moment moving, one moment heads-down dealing with the day-to-day, one moment being allowed (a little) to plan and to dream.</p>

<p>I guess I never really thought about what it would look like to be here, in my late 20&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve always had a hazy vision about what it might look like, but I never expected to feel so <em>young</em>, or feel so unsure, or simultaneously sure. I have my moments when I think to myself dude, I&rsquo;ve lived it up so far. And other seasons I&rsquo;m wondering <em>ok, so now what&rsquo;s the next step?</em></p>

<p>I think this is where Annie and I are different &mdash; she loves the experience of the new, and so lives her life at the place of risk, discomfort, and new experiences. I love the comfort of familiarity, loving the feeling of mastery and the deepening of purpose and relationship.</p>

<p>I love the feeling of running, and the mastery of achieving a PR, or new distance goal. Or I love the feeling of deepening my knowledge or technique around a programming methodology or principle, refining and creating.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m learning that I&rsquo;m scared too, to live at the razor&rsquo;s edge of risk. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m learning to do recently. To make a move, to try to put myself out there again to change things up. To see what&rsquo;s outside of myself. Who knows what I&rsquo;ll find?</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how Annie and I will do with the reality of her grad school looming in the horizon. Of course, I&rsquo;m unsure about how long distance will play out with us. But as much as I hate the uncertainty, and I&rsquo;m anxious about the future, and how much I hate having conficts or feeling misunderstood, I feel like I can trust myself and trust my gut. You&rsquo;ve lived long enough to know this. Trust your gut. Trust in your father. There are Good things ahead.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To be honest? This year felt a little like autopilot. Like I was caught
dealing with <em>Life</em> as it happened, doing a zillion different things
(like I always do) and realizing that I needed to catch up with the
changes. At times, this year felt like waiting for things to happen to me.
Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Life is all about changes. Friends move away, jobs change, roles morph, and I found
myself wondering on more than one occasion &mdash; what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling like I&rsquo;m being constantly faced with the struggle &mdash; how can
I change? How can I grow? Where it feels like sometimes my friends are
moving forward with their lives, there was a bit of soul-searching to be
done this year &mdash; what am I doing nowadays? Is there something I need to
be doing to grow and move forward?</p>

<p>Not much has changed in my life in the outside this year. I still work
at the same place. I&rsquo;m in the same community, and my friends are still
the same. Things are pretty good, and pretty stable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a creature of habit, and it takes a lot of external forces to make
me move. I don&rsquo;t like to travel (too much), preferring a trail run or a
good read or some heads-down coding time. I&rsquo;m a homebody, and I&rsquo;d much
rather spend my vacation time just relaxing at a nearby cafe. I&rsquo;ve eaten
oatmeal for breakfast, coffee in the morning, and lentils for dinner
wayyy too many times to count, (and gotten a lot of grief for it :) ).</p>

<p>But when do these habits start getting in the way of growth, or others'
growth? I&rsquo;ve learned that I have much to grow in my leadership. My
tendency is to focus way too much on the detail and not enough in the
strategy and vision. If you&rsquo;ve asked me what I was going to do two years
in the future, I&rsquo;d honestly have trouble telling you what that would be.</p>

<p>I wrestle with delegation, and sometimes I find myself in roles that
aren&rsquo;t fit for me anymore and not quite keeping up with my own growth.</p>

<p>So one of my hopes in my growth this year is to acknowledge change and
embrace transition and, hell, maybe even lean into some changes of my
own. At time of writing, I have no idea what that may mean, but the
thought is exciting and unappetizing and terrifying and that in itself
is probably a sign that that is What I Might Need. Maybe I need to go on
vacation more. Delegate more aggressively. Keep ruminating on long-term
dreams. Stuff like that. Yeah.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why I named this blog &ldquo;Finding Momentum&rdquo; so many years
ago &mdash; to crystallize a deep want to grow, adapt, and mature.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mike calls me out of the blue.</p>

<p>I pick up the receiver to a sonic wave of grief. They shot my baby, he wails, they took my girl.</p>

<p>You loved her a lot, I offer, the words stumbling out of my mouth.</p>

<p>I loved her like my own.</p>

<p>Her daddy passed away in November. Harry. He helped me move into my apartment, put in the down payment&hellip; now he&rsquo;s gone.</p>

<p>Wailing, the sobs come in waves. Bubbling, snorting, sniffling. Mike is a mess.</p>

<p>Listen.</p>

<p>I took Jubrille shopping just last week to get boots. Right out here &mdash; that Skechers on Bancroft? Giovana didn&rsquo;t like this one pair that Jubrille really liked oh God oh god oh gawd oh god</p>

<p>Silence from time to time&hellip; hello? Silence. Hello?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still here.</p>

<p>She was the last of 2012&hellip; I wish I was the last of 2012. I&rsquo;m done, Drew, I&rsquo;m done. It hurts so bad. Why&rsquo;d they take my baby?</p>

<p>How&rsquo;s Belinda?</p>

<p>The sobbing continues. She&rsquo;s&hellip; bad, Drew. Belinda&rsquo;s doing bad. You gotta call her man.</p>

<p>Jabrille, Gabriel, Jabrille, Gabriel &mdash; like the angel. Here&rsquo;s her picture.</p>

<p>Mike shows a video to me from his phone, taking his time to swipe through about twenty different pictures. There the image is, her room, shadowy in the afternoon, the sun filtering through dark curtains. Graduation photos, bags from various stores taped to the walls &mdash; FOOT LOCKER, FOREVER 21, H&amp;M. There is the sound of Mike choking back tears. There is a man in the room too, his arms slouched over his knees, giving Mike &amp; camera a long look.</p>

<p>Be strong Mike for my mom and my sister. Pull yourself together. You can&rsquo;t cry.</p>

<p>Giovana is shut off. Won&rsquo;t talk. Can&rsquo;t blame her. Her dad just passed too. And now her sister&hellip;</p>

<p><em>At the farewell funeral I met Giovana, who looked a lot skinnier and wider-eyed than I had imagined her being. She was only a year older than her sister, and walked shyly around the mourners, talking in side glances with her high school friends who looked pained and out of place. Some of them were smiling &mdash; whether it was the incongruity of it all, or using humor to mask deep sadness, I didn&rsquo;t know.</em></p>

<p>The candlelight vigil was last week, but oh man. It&rsquo;s gonna rain, Mike says, I gotta get there and get the teddy bears in her room.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling out of place. The Kingpin owner comes over to our table. Mike says: you hear the news. They took my daughter. Shot over New Years. The shop owner comes over and clutches Mike&rsquo;s phone loosely. Yeah. He looks concerned, then hands the phone back to Mike.</p>

<p>Everywhere I go I see girls that look like Jabrille. I stop and look at them. The other week we came out here and she bought boots at Skechers here. Right here in Berkeley.</p>

<p>Belinda says now you gotta help me raise the girls. So I say to Giovana: first thing is you can&rsquo;t go outside. Don&rsquo;t hang out with your hoochie mama friends. And she didn&rsquo;t say nothing.</p>

<p>Over our table now Mike slides over to me an open newspaper, the SF Chronicle, opened to an article about Malala, Pakistani girl who got shot by the Taliban. Read this? he asks. So sad.</p>

<p>You gotta be strong, Mike. Wait till this all blows over. I gotta be strong. I gotta be strong for Belinda.</p>

<p><em>Jubrille&rsquo;s viewing was the first viewing I&rsquo;ve ever been at, and she looked&hellip; unnatural. Plastic. There used to be a soul in there. Mike would stand over the casket and kissed her on the forehead. Justin and I stood awkwardly and waited in line and paid our respects and then, feeling a bit of displacement, we sat down in the pews and let Mike sit behind us and rattle on about his plans for the obituary. The entire scene felt unreal. Children running around, crawling under the pews, laughing. Belinda, who I finally met, was nicely put together, chatting it up with loved ones. I&rsquo;d overdressed; I had thought to dress up, but felt self-conscious in my tie and nice shoes. Walking back to the van Justin remarked to me and nobody in particular, is it not crazy that this kind of thing happens in Oakland twice a week?</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Years have passed since I&rsquo;ve last written about Mike. I see him every once in awhile in Berkeley, still. I think about him from time to time &mdash; wonder how he&rsquo;s doing. I catch him out the corner of my eye the week before I leave for vacation, hanging around at Gypsy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Mike!&rdquo; I call back to him, and he turns around with a big grin on his face. The sidewalks are soaked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my birthday tomorrow&rdquo; he tells me, and I remember how close to Christmas it is.</p>

<p>We swap phone numbers. He&rsquo;s in possession of an Android phone now. &ldquo;How does this thing work?&rdquo; he asks and laughs to himself. He&rsquo;s showing me photos of himself, now taking classes at a culinary school in SF. Something about that seems incongruous to me and I chuckle inside&hellip; but Mike, well I believe he has the gumption and work ethic to pull it off. I tell him I owe him a birthday lunch, and we part ways.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Flash forward a couple of weeks, and it&rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the new year. I&rsquo;ve left on a run and Mike&rsquo;s left me a voice mail while on my run. I listen to it on the way back, and his voice is hollow, blue, grief-stricken. &ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; chokes the voice on the other end, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22288885/police-identify-girl-killed-oakland-shooting">they shot my baby girl</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>I look up the news article. Jubrille was 15 years old, wanted to be a teacher, and was on her way to the mall with her sister and another friend. The shooter was another teen.</p>

<p>OAKLAND &mdash; A pile of flowers, candles, teddy bears and farewell notes grew by the hour Monday afternoon on a quiet street in East Oakland, but they were little comfort to Mike Harris.</p>

<p>Harris, whose longtime family friend Jubrille Jordan, 15, was fatally shot at the site Sunday afternoon, was awash in tears as he surveyed the makeshift memorial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was my sweetheart. They killed my sweetheart,&rdquo; said Harris, a neatly dressed man in his 50s, as he wiped his eyes. &ldquo;What happened? I don&rsquo;t know, I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jubrille was Oakland&rsquo;s 12th child killed in 2012, and its 131st homicide victim in one of the city&rsquo;s deadliest years in recent memory.</p>

<p>&mdash;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/15-year-old-girl-gunned-down-in-Oakland-4158925.php#ixzz2HXjvynid">San Francisco Chronicle, &ldquo;15-year old girl gunned down in Oakland&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>She was also Oakland&rsquo;s final homicide of 2012. Mike picks up, and I barely make out his words through the sobs.</p>
