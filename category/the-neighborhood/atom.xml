<p>I had a hard time accepting it, but I finally have to admit that I&rsquo;m <em>afraid</em> to live in my new neighborhood.</p>

<p>We found out the other day that our place was robbed two months before we came in. There&rsquo;s a lot of characters that hang out around the liquor store down the street. I <em>think</em> there&rsquo;s a lot of unusual traffic at the house a few doors down. I&rsquo;m finding I&rsquo;m making assumptions about people by their race and ethnicity, and letting fear get in the way. It&rsquo;s nice to sit inside and not go out. Or go out, and not have to come back till late at night.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t hide behind lofty ideals, or mere words and lip service. This isn&rsquo;t easy, again. My fear is clouding everything, and it&rsquo;s taken me a few weeks to admit it.</p>
