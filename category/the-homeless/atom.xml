    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The more I stay here the more I realize that I am <em>tired</em>, I am selfish, I am resentful. I am being changed&mdash;yes&mdash;by entering the lives of people in poverty and seeing the grace of being invited into their lives. Yes, I am learning from them a simple faith and a simple life. But it is difficult, and it&rsquo;s a place I do not know how to inhabit.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to give grace to the people who drink on our doorsteps. I get resentful of people who have entitlement attitudes, and sense a creeping sense of dread of answering the doorbell to give food to folks who ask for it. I&rsquo;m tired of cleaning up human shit from our sidewalks and parking lot. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that my biggest fear is that I will annihilate myself in service, deeds, good works and on top of that <em>nothing will change.</em></p>

<p>Once Dave and I busted out onto the entranceway where homeless folks sleep on our doorstep because they were making a drunken racket. We yelled at them, hard: pointed at their beer bottles&mdash;<em>don&rsquo;t you ever drink on our doorstep again!</em>&mdash;gesticulating angrily, adrenaline flaring&mdash;<em>don&rsquo;t you lie to me! You can&rsquo;t sleep here anymore.</em> Yes, it was a power trip. No, we couldn&rsquo;t tolerate the noise and racket they were putting up. Yes, they were annoying the entire neighborhood. No, we weren&rsquo;t doing it very lovingly. Who&rsquo;s right? What was the right thing to do? Where was Jesus, and what would he have done?</p>

<p>They returned the next night.</p>

<p>I think we romanticize urban ministry sometimes, serving the poor, but have forgotten to count the cost. I often feel like that rich young ruler who, having heard Jesus' call to sell his possessions and leave a comfortable life, leaves sad. Because honestly, I do not know if I want to be here.</p>

<p>Lord, help me. Jesus, show me where you are <em>right here, right now</em>. I don&rsquo;t like dwelling in the tension of the brokenness of my neighborhood and the peace that is far away, already promised but not yet here. I know the answer is somewhere in hearing the inner voice of Love, in simply being a son and being Loved. Right now, I just feel stuck.</p>

<p>Last night I went back home to the quiet streets of Saratoga and I knew I couldn&rsquo;t go back. It didn&rsquo;t feel <em>real</em>. But I don&rsquo;t want to stay here either, swimming through the garbage in my soul and not knowing how to be well. Do I want to be well?, the Healer asks. Yes, but help my unbelief.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re all holding hands on the street. Bear on my left, a stocky, grizzled Filipino dude wearing a hard expression under squinting eyes. Pancho on my right, a wiry black man with a thin face and a black &ldquo;OAKLAND&rdquo; beanie with big, gothic lettering. Cece is between the men, finishing a prayer: &ldquo;And keep us alllll&rdquo;&mdash;she draws out the word in her Native-American accent&mdash;&ldquo;safe from the <em>Devil</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amens all around.</p>

<p>Cece is direct, and I like that about her. She&rsquo;ll show up at the door and ask for a couple bucks for bus fare, or maybe a hot meal for the evening. No BS about your place burning to the ground, or needing travel fare to visit your newly-discovered relatives in Tuscon.</p>

<p>She reminds me of a bird, her beaked nose giving rise to sleepy eyes encased with gold wire-rimmed glasses. She waves her head about when she speaks, side-to-side like a pigeon&rsquo;s. You can see it particularly when she&rsquo;s off on one of her rambling episodes, going off about the weather, or about her Christmas, or the long bus route to Richmond, where she and her son Lamoine used to live in a shelter. Tonight&mdash;&ldquo;I got two kids with me&rdquo; &mdash; I am surprised to discover they are a little older.</p>

<p>Bear and Pancho, as far as I can tell, are Cece&rsquo;s friends, mid-twenties men dressed in black, hands in pockets and (I think) looking dangerous. I heat the food and find the three of them are waiting on the railing off to the side of our front entrance, where churchgoers are warily exiting the evening service. I drop off the food before Cece, who along with Pancho begin rifling through the contents.</p>

<p>Pancho slaps my hand in greeting and immediately informs me he used to sleep on the steps out here. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen me around.&rdquo; Come to think about it, he does seem familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheee-yit&rdquo; Bear exclaims with a smirk, &ldquo;Can I tell you a story? Some spirits live out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>eveningtime, it is bitterly cold, he wakes to the sensation of being lifted and dragged. upward, upward he floats. he is flailing, someone, something has snatched him by the leg and he is now ten, twenty, thirty feet in the air (up by the tower, he gestures up overhead). he is let down and on his leg are finger marks, scratches, blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sleeping here no more.&rdquo; He stares out into the parking lot, a blank expression on his face. Bear has found another place to stay by the McDonalds on 17th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah right, you can believe a lotta things,&rdquo; Pancho exclaims as he digs through a macaroni plate with his fingers. &ldquo;You was just crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that,&rdquo; I tell them. &ldquo;That stuff happens.&rdquo; Bear gives me a worried look, which turns to confusion.</p>

<p>Cece interjects, &ldquo;the <em>Devil</em> is REAL. He come to get me in my <em>dreams</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>she is a teenaged girl, though raised in a native american church out on 98th ave (her uncle was a priest) she left the Great Spirit to live the wild life, and oftentimes in her dreams she sees a figure, dark, red eyes, hovering. it is often hard to breathe and she has to try with all her strength to whisper the name of jesus, jesus, jesus. these days, the devil is after her nephew who presses a knife into her hands and tells her with a fearful smile: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need it, moms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that too,&rdquo; I say, and Cece smiles, looking around, satisfied.</p>

<p>Pancho knocks me on the forearm and chuckles, gesturing to Bear and Cece. &ldquo;Listen, I think the Devil ain&rsquo;t what we see in the movies with the <em>horns</em> and maybe the pitchfork. He&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t elaborate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that shit&rsquo;s real man, I ain&rsquo;t never coming out here again.&rdquo; Bear interjects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Devil</em> is REAL. He come to me in my DREAMS!" Cece has gone off rambling again, her voice whiny and raspy and full of trembling fear. Her eyes dart about as her head bobs and her voice shrinks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t gotta be afraid when we got God on our side.&rdquo; Pancho finishes.</p>

<p>We talk about Jesus. It&rsquo;s crazy, like a little church service.</p>

<p>Pancho: &ldquo;You know, I think Jesus beat the devil by going to the cross we don&rsquo;t gotta be afraid no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;I think that the name of Jesus is powerful and even the demons have got to submit to his name. I&rsquo;ve seen stuff like this happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bear: &ldquo;For real?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pancho: &ldquo;Oh <em>yeah</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cece is still rambling.</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;For real. You need to call on Jesus next time that stuff happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bear: &ldquo;Listen man, can we have a prayer? I could use a prayer tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cece quiets down and nods her head.</p>

<p>Without a word, everybody extends a hand. Bear starts the prayer (&ldquo;Um I don&rsquo;t know how to do this man&rdquo;), Cece finishes us off (&ldquo;Aaaaa-man!&rdquo;). And amen.</p>
