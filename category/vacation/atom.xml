    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Paris, I confess I don’t really get you. I mean, it’s amazing being here,
walking your cobblestone streets, taking in the sights and sounds. Your
language is beautiful, melodic, and silky, so much so that I’m
embarrassed when I try to speak it — the words kind of slip out of my
mouth and I lower my voice to avoid the embarrassment of
mispronunciation (several people have assumed that I’ve simply grunted,
and for some reason my face has flushed red).</p>

<p>You know, I don’t appreciate being hawked at, or grabbed by the hand,
trinkets pushed into my hand. I looked up from my phone once and walked
past a few of your street vendors when I felt two hands on my wrists,
and in a panic I pushed them off and stuffed my phone into my pocket and
felt a hot flash of anger and annoyance. Don’t touch me. I guess I
thought I was going to be robbed, more of an instinct. Obviously I
wasn’t, but that put me in a sour mood for a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>I think I understand why Parisiennes don’t claim to love Americans —
it’s because Americans like me don’t even try to learn your language.
I’ve imagined them all thinking in their heads as I stand with them in
silence in an elevator, or wordlessly jab my finger at a croissant in a
window, “Why does he not speak our language? Why can’t he even say ‘one
croissant, please?’”? I’m making it up in my mind, of course, but I’m
caught off guard in the moment that I have no idea how to say it, and
that it never even crossed my mind to figure out how.</p>

<p>On the crowded subway train in from the airport a couple days ago, I
reached down to pull up my luggage. We were packed in, neck to neck,
breathing down each others’ necks. The African lady standing directly in
front of me said something in French — something stern, I gathered — and
I panicked because the words meant nothing to me, and I was, for once,
the dumb one, the mute one. I mumbled (or grunted), then dropped my bag
and decided against pulling it up.</p>

<p>Later on, I figured out what she said: “The train door opens on that
side.”</p>

<p>It’s rained much here for the few days that we’re here — and as we walk
around I’ve seen several girls that are on the verge of tears. One was
looking gloomily out a subway train window. Another was walking
hand-in-hand with another man, her eyes about to pour. What happened to
them? Are they melancholy because of the weather? Is the chilly air
drying out their contacts? What are they thinking? Did their
superhandsome French boyfriends break up with them? What is exactly so
romantic about this place?</p>

<p>We walk and roam your streets and find, to our dismay, the majority of
shops and plazas shut down for the New Years’ festivities. It wasn’t so
disappointing the first time, but on the third or fourth time you visit
some place only to see shuttered doors, it can be a bit of a blow. My
dad suggests we go someplace to eat, and we don’t do too poorly on our
share of baguettes, crepes, omelettes, and waffles.</p>

<p>Here I feel a strong aversion to the mobs and New Years’ partygoers. All
I really want to find is a small cafe in a quiet part of town and sit
down with a good book or a laptop to get some coding done (I’m a nerd
like that). The first was found in a rainy maze outside the Royal Palace
— I had a cappuccino and sat by a long, foggy window and watched
tourists pour out of the building, dodging rain. The second was a tiny
shop I swear you could have found in the Mission, or somewhere in
Brooklyn: young hipsters crowded around little tables, artisan,
single-origin coffee being ground, the aromatic oils blooming to fill
the entire cafe. Ah.</p>

<p>But really, Paris, you won me over tonight. It wasn’t really anything
that you had done, but it was a moment I had by myself on a short jog
along the canal. I crossed over your bridges and there, at the top of
one, I realized something. Maybe it was the eerie quiet and calm you had
— you, a city of 2 million! — and the streetlights reflecting over the
water. I stood and realized that I want to come back again. Maybe
there’s a reason why people affix locks to your bridges, in hopes that a
part of them is tied to you so they may return. It had stopped raining;
I could find no slice of the moon. A couple murmured beneath a dimmed
shop window. My heart was still pounding; my breath short. Paris, I’m
hoping that I’ll be back soon.</p>

    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2011/12/29/sitting-across-from-_e88081e5b8ab-vis-his-noodle-soup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>He slowly slurps his noodles in front of me, and I take him for a professor, an old man with a certain academic flair. Of course, I have no such reason for thinking so, he could be any old man at this nondescript, jam-packed hole-in-the-wall restaurant (the best kind). A sky-blue collared shirt hides beneath the neckline of his sweater, the kind that men in their fifties protestingly receive from their smiling wives and children on their birthdays that they don’t remember themselves.</p>

<p><em>slurp slurp slurp</em> he goes, maneuvering his chopsticks to take in the noodles one by one. They are oily, and slide pleasantly off his chopsticks. I’m across from him, waiting for my bowl and writing in this journal, wondering if he notices that I write in English, no way can I write in Chinese anymore, wondering if he picks out the broken Mandarin I offer the waiter (<em>炸酱面 (zha jiang mian)?</em> I offer wiltingly) (it slips out of my mouth and flops onto the floor).</p>

<p>He is methodical, I can see him in the same light in his lecture (Physics? Artificial Intelligence? Geology? Rennaisance Lit?), perhaps pausing thoughtfully after a student’s question (looking up at the flourescent bulbs, absentmindedly twirling the query around his chalk piece as it hovers over the board. So much hesitation: the students wait with bated breath). Then he writes something with bold forceful strokes, saying nothing, but it is profound! I can’t see the board, but it is brilliant and the classroom gasps (but not too loudly, for a Confucian respect of teachers). If you look closely, a wry grin tugs at the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>Five minutes pass, ten, fifteen. He just keeps his eyes down and soon the eggplant on his plate is gone, the soup lays placid, the red chili oil pools on the plate. I reconsider: he looks uncomfortable, maybe even lonely.</p>

<p>He never looks up to acknowledge my presence, but perhaps that’s because that’s the custom here when strangers are seated at the same table. It was bound to happen (I walked in alone this afternoon; there was no way they would give me my own table at this crowded noodle shop).</p>

<p>That would never fly in the good ol’ USA (God bless the USA). We believe in <em>personal space</em>, as in spacious skies and as in amber waves of grain! God bless the USA where we have six-lane main streets and cowboys and hipsters and Wal-Mart™ and Cafe Gratitude (the Berkeley cafe where the cheesecake there is called <em>“Beautiful”</em>, and to order it you have to force yourself to tell the waiter <em>I am… uh… Beautiful</em>). God bless the USA where everything is Occupied and people are angry and proud and scared at the same time. I too am proud of being American, see my Reeboks™ and crisp English and my silent, snobby mental critiques and my Moleskine™ full of English letters, aye be cee dee yee whoops—a flick of a stray noodle stains a page with sesame oil.</p>

<p><em>Slurp slurp slurp</em>, the Senior Gentleman in front of me takes it all in stride, which is to say he never notices me. Does he want to leave? I half hope so, because the foreign, American me is feeling awkward sitting across from this stranger. He rummages in his bag, composed as ever, smacking his lips. Standing, he takes an awfully long time to put on his windbreaker, buttoning from the top to the bottom, <em>pop, pop, pop</em>, shuffling as he walks out to pay the bill.</p>

<p>But no, I decide he carries an air of simplicity, not in a shortsighted or fumbling way, but in a sagely manner that quiets me and piques my interest. The way a <em>laoshi</em> should teach. I let that image float for a bit, then get up to pay my bill.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been running for the past week or so, despite my grandma’s protests (“you’ll catch a cold”). It used to be easier with the jet lag, when I’d get up at 5am and stare at the wall and catch myself wondering <em>where</em> exactly I was.</p>

<p>It’s been generally drizzly here for the past week or so, which is a blessing and a curse. I’ve felt self-conscious since arriving, noticing that nobody here runs, and I wonder if I’m being too aggressive, pushing too fast when I dodge the passersbys. I’ve decided there is no better feeling than running with the rain slipping off your skin, hot breath hovering between your chest and your shirt while dodging cars and scooters and disapproving old ladies. It’s a powerful feeling, and a very <em>living</em> thing to be doing.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Everything’s concrete here, and my knees are feeling it. It’s not like it used to be, when my dad would run barefoot on the <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2008/05/12/in-my-dads-shoes/">banks of the Xindian River</a> in his boyhood hometown. Nowadays the whole deal is paved over with asphalt and tile and basketball courts, a veritable concrete jungle.</p>

<p>“Let’s go see the river” my Dad announces one day. On the day we are to go, preceding events yawn and billow and suddenly we can’t work the visit in.</p>

<p>One morning I decide to visit anyways and head out early, stepping out into brilliant sunlight (it’s been raining the whole week). I’m taking the roads, out behind <em>fuzhoushan</em> park, down <em>keelung</em> road, past treasure hill and on out to the bike paths by the river. It’s exhausting, and an hour later I’m there. The river is muddled, uninspiring; it cuts a wide swath and lies flat and unperturbed (lifeless, I decide). Cars and city noise roar over bridges, expressways. Concrete frames the landscape, creeping into the banks of the river and damming its tributaries.</p>

<p>I try to imagine my dad as a kid again, playing barefoot in glassy waters and catching fish in a carefree <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>-esque existence. Maybe I’m in the wrong place. Maybe he lived in an alternate space, time, and riverbank where the factories and skyscrapers haven’t yet grown and his toes sink into moist earth. Whatever it is, the sun is in my eyes and I want to go home.</p>

<p>On the heels of that post and in a different spirit, I also want to say that I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying this trip to Portland <a href="my.opera.com/nosabe332">with</a> <a href="stillhouette.com">some</a> <a href="themarrow.wordpress.com">friends</a>. Good eats, good company and a lot of coffee, food trucks, walking, cooking, good beer, beautiful runs, downtime, and trees.</p>

<p>That, plus like 30% of our waking time has been spent at this table at <a href="http://www.powells.com/locations/powells-city-of-books/">Powell&rsquo;s City of Books</a>. Books are cool, kids. I am reminded that I like words, particularly ones that are strung together nicely.</p>
