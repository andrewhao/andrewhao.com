    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Push and pull, move and wait. I&rsquo;m in a season of waiting, of settling down. One moment moving, one moment heads-down dealing with the day-to-day, one moment being allowed (a little) to plan and to dream.</p>

<p>I guess I never really thought about what it would look like to be here, in my late 20&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve always had a hazy vision about what it might look like, but I never expected to feel so <em>young</em>, or feel so unsure, or simultaneously sure. I have my moments when I think to myself dude, I&rsquo;ve lived it up so far. And other seasons I&rsquo;m wondering <em>ok, so now what&rsquo;s the next step?</em></p>

<p>I think this is where Annie and I are different &mdash; she loves the experience of the new, and so lives her life at the place of risk, discomfort, and new experiences. I love the comfort of familiarity, loving the feeling of mastery and the deepening of purpose and relationship.</p>

<p>I love the feeling of running, and the mastery of achieving a PR, or new distance goal. Or I love the feeling of deepening my knowledge or technique around a programming methodology or principle, refining and creating.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m learning that I&rsquo;m scared too, to live at the razor&rsquo;s edge of risk. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m learning to do recently. To make a move, to try to put myself out there again to change things up. To see what&rsquo;s outside of myself. Who knows what I&rsquo;ll find?</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how Annie and I will do with the reality of her grad school looming in the horizon. Of course, I&rsquo;m unsure about how long distance will play out with us. But as much as I hate the uncertainty, and I&rsquo;m anxious about the future, and how much I hate having conficts or feeling misunderstood, I feel like I can trust myself and trust my gut. You&rsquo;ve lived long enough to know this. Trust your gut. Trust in your father. There are Good things ahead.</p>
