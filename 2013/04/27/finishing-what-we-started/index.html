<div class="entry-content lettrine"><p>One thing I like about volunteering with RBO is the chance to meet up with kids from all different parts of Oakland. This year I was paired up with S, a kid from the Fruitvale district attending a local charter school just a few blocks from me.</p>

<p>S is a soft kid, a quiet kid. He isn&rsquo;t quick to volunteer himself, so our runs consist of me talking a lot, or asking him questions, and him politely answering them.</p>

<p>Our worlds are different &mdash; I grew up in wealthy Saratoga, where our biggest concerns were about our GPAs, studying for the SATs, or when we&rsquo;d inherit our parents&#8217; cars. S grew up in the hood, where everybody around him is gang-affiliated. Every Saturday morning at seven he jumps on two buses and comes out to our workouts on the south end of the lake by himself.</p>

<p>His best friend is Z, a slender Mexican-American kid like S, who became fast friends at their current school. Z has already developed the qualities of a young ringleader &mdash; brash, handsome, funny, a friend of trouble, and still hesitant and vulnerable behind his persona in a way that thirteen-year olds are.</p>

<p>Our workouts together would consist of the two friends running together, and Z volunteering uninvited facts about his friend: &ldquo;Did you know that S is the handsomest guy at school. He&rsquo;s a player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>S: (chuckles to himself)</p>

<p>Z: &ldquo;Him and me stopped being friends because he was seeing this girl, and I told him that she was trouble but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Oh yeah? What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talk about her at length.</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the deal with you guys now? You&rsquo;re still friends right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Z: &ldquo;Yeah, I went away and wrote him a letter and said I still wanted to be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two weeks later S reports back to me: I&rsquo;ve broken up with that girl, Z was right.</p>

<p>And then he tells me he&rsquo;s dating someone else now, her friend. I laugh.</p>

<hr />

<p>What&rsquo;s it like when everyone around you is living a grit-filled life? When cop cars and sirens and gunshots are your common reality?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me and my sister are close&rdquo; S says, &ldquo;but she protects me&rdquo; &mdash; her sister was jumped into a gang two years ago (I am surprised to learn she is only 14).</p>

<p>They are close, but so far apart. S has resolved to keep his head up and out of gangs, but his sister is deep in gang life. They&rsquo;re close, they fight, yet they love each other. He tells a story of nearly getting jumped himself, but for the protests of his sister, was let go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you stay out of the gang scene?&rdquo; I ask him.</p>

<p>He shrugs. &ldquo;They kind of know you&rsquo;re so-and-so&rsquo;s sister, and won&rsquo;t bother you.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>On one of our runs, Z and S were running together when S blurts out, &ldquo;Z once made me swallow a staple&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? How did that happen?&rdquo; I ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He dared me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Z&rsquo;s eyes twinkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It got stuck in my throat and I got scared and I had to go to the hospital&rdquo;, S says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst part was at the hospital, when I had to talk to his mom.&rdquo; Z shudders. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hella scary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>S just laughs.</p>

<hr />

<p>On our Oakland Half Marathon run this year, S and I were running past the West Oakland entrance to the Port, and I was talking to him about all the things we could see if we went over the bridge &mdash; Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, the Crucible, Brown Sugar Kitchen. &ldquo;Have you seen those things before?&rdquo; I ask. He responds no.</p>

<p>A half mile passes in silence, and then he volunteers, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many things I haven&rsquo;t seen&hellip; it&rsquo;s tough to see past all the violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We run a bit more in silence.</p>

<hr />

<p>S and I run a steady, paced half marathon together, and you can see his spirits rise as he pushes through his pain to get across the finish line, tired and happy. Z is somewhere behind us, having cramped up but he finishes too. And I&rsquo;m overcome with pride for S and what he&rsquo;s fighting for in his life.</p>

<p>(Tired and happy.)</p>
