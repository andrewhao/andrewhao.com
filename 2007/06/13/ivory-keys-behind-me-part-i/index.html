<div class="entry-content lettrine"><p>I switched piano teachers in the sixth grade. My first teacher was a kindly, aging American man by the name of John. My earliest memories of piano lessons were of me sitting in an antique chair his dim, musky studio. I&rsquo;d pretend I was sleeping so I could skim a couple of minutes off my lesson, always to be awakened by a couple of his cats brushing by. I suspect they consulted with some other Chinese parents and came to the conclusion that John didn&rsquo;t push me hard enough. That&rsquo;s when they switched me to Natalia&rsquo;s studio.</p>

<p>Her name was Natalia, but my mother somehow confused it with Natasha. I remember my mother got it wrong on the first day, when she greeted Natalia with a handshake and I peered over at a few of her recital handouts on the piano bench and noticed the correct spelling. This sort of awkward greeting continued over the next five years, but I never did bother correcting my mom.</p>

<p>Natalia was Russian, and we students all knew what that meant&mdash;intensity. Russian piano teachers rank at the top of the intensity scale, followed only by Chinese piano teachers (but not by much). Yes, that is a tongue-in-cheek statement.</p>

<p>But yes, Natalia was intense (and I&rsquo;m pretty sure any number of us could testify about our own piano instructors). I don&rsquo;t know how to describe this facial expression of hers&mdash;a cross between concern and intense concentration, perpetually across her face. I think I can count on my fingers the number of times I ever saw her smile.</p>

<p>Okay, so I never practiced. I couldn&rsquo;t! After all I had tons of other stuff to do. Practice was boring. And I always played well enough&hellip;</p>

<p>Well enough for me, I suppose. I think every one of those lessons, I got the Glare and/or a lot of nagging and yelling. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you practiced?&rdquo; &ldquo;This part sounds terrible&rdquo; &ldquo;Play this section like I told you to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now all of these statements were true (and well-deserved). But in my mind, I had made up my mind that Natalia was against me. After all, Natalia&rsquo;s roster of students included many to-be prodigies. Actually I think every one of her students was an outstanding pianist who always topped their level in the CM examinations and put beaming smiles on their parents&#8217; faces.</p>

<p>I always walked in thinking I was going to disappoint her. And for pretty much every weekly lesson those five years, I walked out feeling frustrated and worthless.</p>
