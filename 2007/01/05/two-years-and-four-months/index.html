<div class="entry-content lettrine"><p>There are four of us in this room, keeping the six-o&#8217;clock watch marking the sun&rsquo;s descent in this myrtle-green nightclub undergoing transformation to a sacred space, sawdust filling our nostrils and uncovering shafts of light leaking from skylights (and I sneeze).</p>

<p>One corner of the room is a cafe in a half-constructed state with orange walls, orange booths and orange tables whose similarity to a &lsquo;50s diner is uncanny, down to the sticky vinyl seats and fading chrome accents around the seat bases.</p>

<p>A Latino man and his wife, renowned prayer intercessors (or so I am
told when they enter the room an hour earlier) are silently kneeling
in the center of the room, their lips moving and eyebrows furrowed in
intense concentration (I try to search for words to describe their expressions, and come up with nothing better than &ldquo;pleading&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The other end of the room is a wall of clear glass cubes affording a view at an empty concrete courtyard which previously saw life as a swimming pool, no doubt among the young, glitzy and the glamourous (tonight, it is barren).</p>

<p>My friend Andy, tall, bronzed and lanky in torn jeans and a &ldquo;Trust Me I&rsquo;m a Doctor&rdquo; tee shirt is walking about in a meandering circle, hands stuffed in his pockets and whispering confident words I cannot decipher as I only hear the escaping hisses of the &ldquo;s&rdquo; consonant.</p>

<p>sss (silence) ss tss (silence)</p>

<p>Three walls and the ceiling of the club are painted black (ironically), and I, sprawled out and lying on my back, imagine I am staring into a nighttime sky and not knowing what to pray, faced with the immense loneliness of stars and sky, wondering who am I (who I am) and what exactly I am praying for (for in two weeks I leave for college, releasing behind me a mess of unrealized hopes and hearsay)&mdash;little less sure if anything lies between the stars I see in dark ceilings.</p>

<p>(I remember watching a video in fifth grade&mdash;an array of numbers spins
up to 4.39 years&mdash;for the time light from our closest star, Alpha
Centauri, takes to reach the outer edges of our Solar System. The
thought of waiting four years for light had boggled my mind. What
happened in the meantime? Did darkness just wait? And who was counting?)</p>

<p>I still can&rsquo;t remember to this day how Andy and I met, but for meeting up with him after we had corresponded a couple of times via email and talking about his crazy idea of starting a student prayer vigil, 24s of hours continually (24 soon bloomed to 48 bloomed to 72) and every time we were unsure about going through with another one I just remember his confident yeah man, let&rsquo;s do it (there was no doubt).</p>

<p>Andy was one of the cool kids, but I suspect this was less because he was handsome or rode a Kawasaki motorbike (comparisons were drawn to Korean pop stars and helped his case with the ladies), but because he had this cool confidence about him that had his friends wonder where he got it, and they quickly wished he didn&rsquo;t have it when he got up on lunch tables during senior year at 12PM and started talking about Jesus-following (the faculty had asked him to stop but he couldn&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>The man motions to Andy and me to join them in the middle of the room; we gather and he begins to speak of the burden for the city and for the church, big things and beautiful things and humbling things and sorrowful things, and I see in this man the brokenness of a man whose heart is chained to the people his God loves (I change my mind, the correct word for his expression is &ldquo;mournful&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Then he begins to share God-inspired things to Andy, speaking out the Father&rsquo;s love for his son, speaking beautiful words into his future, beautiful words really, of leadership, of preparedness, of assurance, of confidence and of commissioning to Andy, who breathes deeply and keeps his eyes closed.</p>

<p>Then it&rsquo;s my turn, and I look up and wait for the stars on the ceiling to come down, for my pinpricks of faith amidst dashed hopes to suddenly fall ablaze from the sky and for this I will let him speak.</p>

<p>And the man, in a steady measured voice full of compassion, simply tells me God wants you to wait&mdash;and listen. So much. Keep waiting for him.</p>

<p>I brush aside those words and hastily suppress disappointment that they were not large-words, not even close! but words that demanded that I not have any (oh God, I know it is true.) Andy&rsquo;s hand is on my shoulder and we utter soundless words.</p>
