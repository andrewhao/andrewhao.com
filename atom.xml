    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/8688066540/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8688066540_7aa44150a0.jpg" alt="RBO @ the Oakland Running Festival" /></a> Some RBO youth take off at the start line.[/caption]</p>

<p>One thing I like about volunteering with RBO is the chance to meet up with kids from all different parts of Oakland. This year I was paired up with S, a kid from the Fruitvale district attending a local charter school just a few blocks from me.</p>

<p>S is a soft kid, a quiet kid. He isn&rsquo;t quick to volunteer himself, so our runs consist of me talking a lot, or asking him questions, and him politely answering them.</p>

<p>Our worlds are different &mdash; I grew up in wealthy Saratoga, where our biggest concerns were about our GPAs, studying for the SATs, or when we&rsquo;d inherit our parents&#8217; cars. S grew up in the hood, where everybody around him is gang-affiliated. Every Saturday morning at seven he jumps on two buses and comes out to our workouts on the south end of the lake by himself.</p>

<p>His best friend is Z, a slender Mexican-American kid like S, who became fast friends at their current school. Z has already developed the qualities of a young ringleader &mdash; brash, handsome, funny, a friend of trouble, and still hesitant and vulnerable behind his persona in a way that thirteen-year olds are.</p>

<p>Our workouts together would consist of the two friends running together, and Z volunteering uninvited facts about his friend: &ldquo;Did you know that S is the handsomest guy at school. He&rsquo;s a player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>S: (chuckles to himself)</p>

<p>Z: &ldquo;Him and me stopped being friends because he was seeing this girl, and I told him that she was trouble but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Oh yeah? What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talk about her at length.</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the deal with you guys now? You&rsquo;re still friends right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Z: &ldquo;Yeah, I went away and wrote him a letter and said I still wanted to be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two weeks later S reports back to me: I&rsquo;ve broken up with that girl, Z was right.</p>

<p>And then he tells me he&rsquo;s dating someone else now, her friend. I laugh.</p>

<hr />

<p>What&rsquo;s it like when everyone around you is living a grit-filled life? When cop cars and sirens and gunshots are your common reality?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me and my sister are close&rdquo; S says, &ldquo;but she protects me&rdquo; &mdash; her sister was jumped into a gang two years ago (I am surprised to learn she is only 14).</p>

<p>They are close, but so far apart. S has resolved to keep his head up and out of gangs, but his sister is deep in gang life. They&rsquo;re close, they fight, yet they love each other. He tells a story of nearly getting jumped himself, but for the protests of his sister, was let go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you stay out of the gang scene?&rdquo; I ask him.</p>

<p>He shrugs. &ldquo;They kind of know you&rsquo;re so-and-so&rsquo;s sister, and won&rsquo;t bother you.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>On one of our runs, Z and S were running together when S blurts out, &ldquo;Z once made me swallow a staple&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? How did that happen?&rdquo; I ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He dared me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Z&rsquo;s eyes twinkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It got stuck in my throat and I got scared and I had to go to the hospital&rdquo;, S says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst part was at the hospital, when I had to talk to his mom.&rdquo; Z shudders. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hella scary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>S just laughs.</p>

<hr />

<p>On our Oakland Half Marathon run this year, S and I were running past the West Oakland entrance to the Port, and I was talking to him about all the things we could see if we went over the bridge &mdash; Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, the Crucible, Brown Sugar Kitchen. &ldquo;Have you seen those things before?&rdquo; I ask. He responds no.</p>

<p>A half mile passes in silence, and then he volunteers, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many things I haven&rsquo;t seen&hellip; it&rsquo;s tough to see past all the violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We run a bit more in silence.</p>

<hr />

<p>S and I run a steady, paced half marathon together, and you can see his spirits rise as he pushes through his pain to get across the finish line, tired and happy. Z is somewhere behind us, having cramped up but he finishes too. And I&rsquo;m overcome with pride for S and what he&rsquo;s fighting for in his life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mike calls me out of the blue.</p>

<p>I pick up the receiver to a sonic wave of grief. They shot my baby, he wails, they took my girl.</p>

<p>You loved her a lot, I offer, the words stumbling out of my mouth.</p>

<p>I loved her like my own.</p>

<p>Her daddy passed away in November. Harry. He helped me move into my apartment, put in the down payment&hellip; now he&rsquo;s gone.</p>

<p>Wailing, the sobs come in waves. Bubbling, snorting, sniffling. Mike is a mess.</p>

<p>Listen.</p>

<p>I took Jubrille shopping just last week to get boots. Right out here &mdash; that Skechers on Bancroft? Giovana didn&rsquo;t like this one pair that Jubrille really liked oh God oh god oh gawd oh god</p>

<p>Silence from time to time&hellip; hello? Silence. Hello?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still here.</p>

<p>She was the last of 2012&hellip; I wish I was the last of 2012. I&rsquo;m done, Drew, I&rsquo;m done. It hurts so bad. Why&rsquo;d they take my baby?</p>

<p>How&rsquo;s Belinda?</p>

<p>The sobbing continues. She&rsquo;s&hellip; bad, Drew. Belinda&rsquo;s doing bad. You gotta call her man.</p>

<p>Jabrille, Gabriel, Jabrille, Gabriel &mdash; like the angel. Here&rsquo;s her picture.</p>

<p>Mike shows a video to me from his phone, taking his time to swipe through about twenty different pictures. There the image is, her room, shadowy in the afternoon, the sun filtering through dark curtains. Graduation photos, bags from various stores taped to the walls &mdash; FOOT LOCKER, FOREVER 21, H&amp;M. There is the sound of Mike choking back tears. There is a man in the room too, his arms slouched over his knees, giving Mike &amp; camera a long look.</p>

<p>Be strong Mike for my mom and my sister. Pull yourself together. You can&rsquo;t cry.</p>

<p>Giovana is shut off. Won&rsquo;t talk. Can&rsquo;t blame her. Her dad just passed too. And now her sister&hellip;</p>

<p><em>At the farewell funeral I met Giovana, who looked a lot skinnier and wider-eyed than I had imagined her being. She was only a year older than her sister, and walked shyly around the mourners, talking in side glances with her high school friends who looked pained and out of place. Some of them were smiling &mdash; whether it was the incongruity of it all, or using humor to mask deep sadness, I didn&rsquo;t know.</em></p>

<p>The candlelight vigil was last week, but oh man. It&rsquo;s gonna rain, Mike says, I gotta get there and get the teddy bears in her room.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling out of place. The Kingpin owner comes over to our table. Mike says: you hear the news. They took my daughter. Shot over New Years. The shop owner comes over and clutches Mike&rsquo;s phone loosely. Yeah. He looks concerned, then hands the phone back to Mike.</p>

<p>Everywhere I go I see girls that look like Jabrille. I stop and look at them. The other week we came out here and she bought boots at Skechers here. Right here in Berkeley.</p>

<p>Belinda says now you gotta help me raise the girls. So I say to Giovana: first thing is you can&rsquo;t go outside. Don&rsquo;t hang out with your hoochie mama friends. And she didn&rsquo;t say nothing.</p>

<p>Over our table now Mike slides over to me an open newspaper, the SF Chronicle, opened to an article about Malala, Pakistani girl who got shot by the Taliban. Read this? he asks. So sad.</p>

<p>You gotta be strong, Mike. Wait till this all blows over. I gotta be strong. I gotta be strong for Belinda.</p>

<p><em>Jubrille&rsquo;s viewing was the first viewing I&rsquo;ve ever been at, and she looked&hellip; unnatural. Plastic. There used to be a soul in there. Mike would stand over the casket and kissed her on the forehead. Justin and I stood awkwardly and waited in line and paid our respects and then, feeling a bit of displacement, we sat down in the pews and let Mike sit behind us and rattle on about his plans for the obituary. The entire scene felt unreal. Children running around, crawling under the pews, laughing. Belinda, who I finally met, was nicely put together, chatting it up with loved ones. I&rsquo;d overdressed; I had thought to dress up, but felt self-conscious in my tie and nice shoes. Walking back to the van Justin remarked to me and nobody in particular, is it not crazy that this kind of thing happens in Oakland twice a week?</em></p>

We finally got a photo together." /></a> Ran into Mike on a rainy day in Berkeley. We finally got a photo together.[/caption]</p>

<p>Years have passed since I&rsquo;ve last written about Mike. I see him every once in awhile in Berkeley, still. I think about him from time to time &mdash; wonder how he&rsquo;s doing. I catch him out the corner of my eye the week before I leave for vacation, hanging around at Gypsy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Mike!&rdquo; I call back to him, and he turns around with a big grin on his face. The sidewalks are soaked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my birthday tomorrow&rdquo; he tells me, and I remember how close to Christmas it is.</p>

<p>We swap phone numbers. He&rsquo;s in possession of an Android phone now. &ldquo;How does this thing work?&rdquo; he asks and laughs to himself. He&rsquo;s showing me photos of himself, now taking classes at a culinary school in SF. Something about that seems incongruous to me and I chuckle inside&hellip; but Mike, well I believe he has the gumption and work ethic to pull it off. I tell him I owe him a birthday lunch, and we part ways.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Flash forward a couple of weeks, and it&rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the new year. I&rsquo;ve left on a run and Mike&rsquo;s left me a voice mail while on my run. I listen to it on the way back, and his voice is hollow, blue, grief-stricken. &ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; chokes the voice on the other end, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22288885/police-identify-girl-killed-oakland-shooting">they shot my baby girl</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>I look up the news article. Jubrille was 15 years old, wanted to be a teacher, and was on her way to the mall with her sister and another friend. The shooter was another teen.</p>

<p>OAKLAND &mdash; A pile of flowers, candles, teddy bears and farewell notes grew by the hour Monday afternoon on a quiet street in East Oakland, but they were little comfort to Mike Harris.</p>

<p>Harris, whose longtime family friend Jubrille Jordan, 15, was fatally shot at the site Sunday afternoon, was awash in tears as he surveyed the makeshift memorial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was my sweetheart. They killed my sweetheart,&rdquo; said Harris, a neatly dressed man in his 50s, as he wiped his eyes. &ldquo;What happened? I don&rsquo;t know, I don&#8217;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jubrille was Oakland&rsquo;s 12th child killed in 2012, and its 131st homicide victim in one of the city&rsquo;s deadliest years in recent memory.</p>

<p>&mdash;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/15-year-old-girl-gunned-down-in-Oakland-4158925.php#ixzz2HXjvynid">San Francisco Chronicle, &ldquo;15-year old girl gunned down in Oakland&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>She was also Oakland&rsquo;s final homicide of 2012. Mike picks up, and I barely make out his words through the sobs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year!</p>

<p>Last night I spent a good amount of time looking back at my journal and saw a few threads that ran through last year:</p>

<p>If 2011 was a year of risk-taking, then 2012, I&rsquo;ve summed up, was a building year, a year to build a rhythm and establish a flow. It was a full year at Blurb, commuting back and forth from SF. Keeping up the same routine at Regen. Stephen Ministry on Mondays, Circuit training Tuesdays, Wednesday mornings with Jeff, home group on Thursdays, Saturday morning runs, Sundays with Betty. Routine and rhythm. It can be good for you.</p>

<p>Knowing who I am, building a flow can be something to settle into but the risk is that I can get too comfortable.  But I found myself up against the reality that your ideals often have a hard time matching up to your reality. So on a serious note, last year was also the first year that I felt like I was just&hellip; <em>coasting</em>. And it felt horrible, the thought and feeling that the kind of life I should have been living should be filled with more risk, more Jesus + his presence. I&rsquo;m learning that I can oftentimes fall into routine and forget myself and why I&rsquo;m here.</p>

<p>There was a season &mdash; I remember it well &mdash; last year when I sat down and wrote down everything I was feeling &mdash; frustration with my life, honest doubts about my purpose and my faith and a slew of questions for God or Jesus or whoever it was that was overseeing my life. Life in Christ is filled with <em>joy</em>, right? Then why wasn&rsquo;t I feeling it? I was tempted to give it all up again.</p>

<p>The intersection of your faith and your daily life can disconnect sometimes, and things had derailed for a long time before I noticed it. The cynicism was subtle, but would crawl into things and inner dialogues. It would rebel against pat answers I saw people giving around me, or the cultural disconnects I&rsquo;d see between the church and Real Life, and a broken world.</p>

<p>The burnout was palpable, but here&rsquo;s the thing: it was something that I didn&rsquo;t do anything about. I kept up the same routines, held the same smiles and had the same answers. But inside there was a gnawing question that reappears from time to time: what is real about my life? Where was that sense that the world is on the brink of something glorious that I felt so often when I was younger&mdash;when things had a surety about them, and answers were more black and white, and joy was real because you were laughing, too? What about the intersection of dirt &amp; the divine, miracles I used to see, or evidence of the supernatural? Where does that stuff just <em>go</em> when you&rsquo;ve lived without them for so long?</p>

<p>Talking to Jeff, I was reminded that the times I felt <em>alive</em> in Christ were the times I was taking risks. So a lot of last year was about asking myself &mdash; where am I going? Where are places I can grow and risks that I can take? And there were a few themes: living in Oakland, identifying with the broken, friendships and brothers, youth &amp; community, silence &amp; solitude.</p>

<p>To be honest, a lot of that has not materialized, and a lot of that were gushy ideas lacking structure and thought and a strong heart.</p>

<p>God, I want that for this year. I want more faith, more experiences of your grace. I want courage to fight for people I love and defend the things I believe in (and vice versa). I want to run toward conflict instead of away from it. I want a stronger, more compassionate heart, and I want to run with people that show that too. But I mainly want to sense your nearness and know you with the familiarity of a son.</p>

    <id>http://andrewhao.github.io/andrewhao/blog/2013/01/01/what-i-did-in-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Competitively, this was a good year. I <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/03/15/already-and-still-not-yet/">ran a 3:05 PR</a> at Napa (yay!), but missed Boston by seconds (argh).</p>

<p>I was <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/05/07/seasons-shift/">frustrated with my plantar fasciitis</a>, but that gave me an opportunity to go into the swim and the bike and there were a lot of good memories doing long bike rides: Mt. Diablo + Mt. Tam with Bruce and friends. I also learned to swim in open water! Did my first <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/07/15/golden-gate-tri-recap/">Olympic tri</a>, with a crazy current. Got a few friends to do a Tri for Fun. Come October, the PF began clearing out and I started hitting the trails again :)</p>

<p>2013 will be the year I attempt my first <a href="http://www.ar50mile.com/">50mi race</a>, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the training runs on the trails. I think I&rsquo;ll end up doing a half-Ironman in there somewhere. And perhaps another attempt at Boston in the fall. Nate&rsquo;s going to be training for Western States, and I figure if I run with that guy enough I should be in good shape&hellip;</p>

<p>2012 was the year I started getting serious about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/andrewhaophotography">photography</a>! I&rsquo;m finding that I&rsquo;m learning a lot more about the craft. Figuring out the technical details is important, but more than that, it&rsquo;s about working with subjects, making them feel at ease. It&rsquo;s about finding light and keeping your eyes open always and going with your gut. It&rsquo;s about taking risks and trying new poses and settings. Wedding-wise, it&rsquo;s about planning, preparation and being on your toes. I have a lot to learn still, and I&rsquo;m excited about 2013&rsquo;s new assignments.</p>

<p>Wejoinin was kind of on the back burner but Hsiu-Fan and I are nearing the completion of a Rails 3 upgrade. More on that soon on my <a href="http://www.g9labs.com">technical blog</a>.</p>

<p>I took trips to Portland, LA, and even South Carolina.</p>

<p>I went to more than a few weddings and saw quite a few friends get hitched. Congratulations!</p>

<p>And&hellip; I started dating again. The feeling&rsquo;s a little surreal, but I like her a lot :)</p>

    <id>http://andrewhao.github.io/andrewhao/blog/2012/12/16/on-aliveness</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two themes running through my journal lately &mdash; one is of intense gratitude: about the things I&rsquo;ve been given and how much I didn&rsquo;t deserve them. They are filled with thankfulness about how things have unfurled with Annie. It&rsquo;s got a lot of awe and wonder at the beauty of the outdoors and the sheer awe of creation.</p>

<p>But its counterpart is written from a part of me that is uncomfortable with my comfort &mdash; feeling sometimes an almost-arrogance at how much I&rsquo;ve gotten things figured out or how much I&rsquo;ve learned or where I am in life. I think a part of myself senses a puffed-upness in my soul, or is wary of a front that I put up from time to time. It&rsquo;s a false self, tied up in schedules and enamored by Having It Together.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to put my finger on it, but it comes and goes with a sort of numbness to the Gospel that creeps up, accompanied with various flavors of cynicism. Thinking to myself that the times I felt God&#8217;s presence the most were the times when I was humbled the most and almost wanting to crawl back to that place again, if only to sense the closeness of my father.</p>

<p><em>Bankrupt</em>&hellip; maybe that&rsquo;s a word I&rsquo;m looking for. When I was humbled and begging for God&rsquo;s presence in my life. And now that I&rsquo;m in a place of plenty, there&rsquo;s that sense that I&rsquo;m looking into mirrors and still missing the real thing. Jesus, be near to me now. I want to know your voice. I want to know simple things to be important things, like iron friendships and unyielding brotherhood, like being a part of your movement, like seeing redemption and miracles and Grace rock people for good, like humble love that is beyond reproach or ridicule.</p>

<p>In the recent theme of grace, maybe one of the reasons I really like country songs and the myths they tell is because you can feel the grit in the stories. Country protagonists live out their flaws fully (for better or worse) but there&rsquo;s always that redemptive thread.</p>

<p>Or maybe I just want to drive a pickup truck.</p>

<p>Onward:</p>

<p>A question worth exploring is: how does my identity as an Asian-American man affect my perception of grace (and my fascination with southern white culture)? Is it self-aware irony, a hipster thing? Does it say something about the dominant culture I live in? Does it reflect on my own view of Asian masculinity (or lack thereof)?</p>

<p>Topics for future discussion, but honestly, I do really just want a pickup truck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sitting at Coffee Society here back home,  journaling and feeling generally overwhelmed by God&rsquo;s goodness. I&rsquo;m not sure when I felt it, but it might have been yesterday&rsquo;s slow, rambling run through the foothills from pre-dawn dusk to midmorning cool, or experiencing the long-anticipated togetherness of a Thanksgiving meal. Or maybe it was just hanging with Annie over lunch and being able to feel like a big brother again, or that my dad just dropped a new iPhone in my lap&hellip; just like that. I&rsquo;m seeing movement in my life, and things feel like they&rsquo;re coming together. I just had the thought&hellip; I can&rsquo;t deserve much of this. Things shouldn&rsquo;t be this good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been realizing lately there&rsquo;s this dichotomy in how I see myself &mdash; on one hand, I have a very outside-in view of myself, painfully aware of others&#8217; perceptions of myself and always trying hard to do things that create a polished image (see: <a href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/typethree.asp#.ULA2NeOe_ls">Enneagram 3</a>, of which I&rsquo;m becoming increasingly convinced of). I can experience myself as a high-performer, a compassionate human, and generally rad dude.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other part of myself that&rsquo;s pretty painfully aware of my flaws and shortcomings. It knows my hiding places and how often I can retreat to them&hellip; the places in myself that I experience fears and insecurities.</p>

<p>The achiever in me lives in fear of failure, the sense that things can&rsquo;t always be this good and I can&rsquo;t enjoy good things because I&rsquo;m bound to eff things up, or the sneaking suspicion that something catastrophic is around the corner. The hidden places in me are always wary of being exposed, or worried that I won&rsquo;t live up to expectations (whose?).</p>

<p>The longer I live the more I&rsquo;m realizing that these two parts of myself are redeemed by the Gospel. In the Gospel I can acknowledge my imposter and broken self. In the Gospel I begin with the fact that I deserved no good gifts, but then I am given something truly Good. It grounds me and humbles me, and most of all it allows me to <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/01/14/foreword/">yield</a> and experience gifts for what they are&hellip; and allow myself to savor the significance of this delight: that I&rsquo;m simply his son, and he&rsquo;s a good Father to me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oakland, tonight I swam in your streets and felt the cool of your night. I think to myself how I feel strong when the pull stroke feels easy, and think to memorize the tones of the sky at dusk when I pull to the side for air &mdash; half the sky a fading incandescent red, the other a fluorescent blue. I find, for a few moments of grace that people shimmer with a quiet mystery when they&rsquo;re underwater, the light from the pool lamps refracting, flexing, arcing over their bodies. To you, Oakland, I feel a sense of sheepishness, I</p>

<p>confess it&rsquo;s taken me years to learn to love you and I realize it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m still guarded when I&rsquo;m around you. It&rsquo;s taken time to understand why the bus lady sings bluesfully to herself at the stop. She does not want your change, but she wants you to recognize her and see her, approach her and hold her. You too have a dual personality, you like your sister are hot and cold. Your people struggle up against each other and quarrel, I remember how Pancho would come back to our steps every night after we told him to leave&mdash;no disrespect, he insisted&mdash;but we&rsquo;d start up all over on the same note. You&rsquo;re my partna right? Right, I&rsquo;d say, knowing it to be the feeblest lie, and wondering if he was being facetious or if I was the most cynical man on earth. You&rsquo;re my partna. Push and pull, push and pull. Oakland, I realize I still don&rsquo;t</p>

<p>get you but I can&rsquo;t let that get me down, because I still sense the electric buzz in your veins, and I have that freeze frame photo of the shimmer during that swim. I still have the sensation of lingering night warmth from the soil after a hot day and the small-sensation I get standing under the expanse of your patchquilt sky.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco wraps me up with hot pumice breath and does not let go. She follows me with a sincerity that I cannot shake, offering the fruits of her cacophony as the throaty rumbling of cable cars, as the muted quarreling of European travelers, blue eyed children in tow, as azalea sunbursts lining the steps I jog each afternoon. She orchestrates the movements of ten thousand bicyclists. She punctuates the skies with glass ornaments and fighter-jet jewels. and lures in her prey with the offerings of raven gold parlayed over her streets. She charms me over then just as quickly, she turns</p>

<p>cold; suddenly I am colored frigid by blasts of air conditioning from cavernous parking garages, blown to and fro through alleyways. Her eyes darken by murky sea gales, and nighttime cools her zeal.</p>

    <id>http://andrewhao.github.io/andrewhao/blog/2012/09/23/on-being-wild</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I miss running barefoot &mdash; there was something about running with the spring in your step, pushing gingerly against the grass, feeling the strength of the stride move through your legs and through your toes that made you feel powerful, or free, or wild. When I first started early on, I always felt sore and achy at the bottom of my foot, like pinpricks lived there. We&rsquo;d joke that running the lake barefoot was safe&mdash;so long as you didn&rsquo;t step on the needles. A few times I felt a sharp pain and swore I did step on one&hellip; only to find out that I was fine. But as the calluses built, your stride adjusted and you would feel safer, and the stones wouldn&rsquo;t cut you anymore and you&rsquo;d run a little faster, leaning into the slicing chill, ignoring the numbness of running on wet grass on the north end of the lake and run home in darkness against the dotted glow of Lake Merritt&rsquo;s necklace.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had the thought where I wished I could have been more wild when I was younger. Maybe it&rsquo;d be kind of cool to grow up and live in some remote town in the forest. I&rsquo;d like to run freely in the dirt and swim in a few lakes. I would have liked to learn how to wrestle and gotten in fights and build forts and bruise a few more knees and kiss a few more girls. I&rsquo;d like to have known the strength in my back and courage in my heart.  I remember always being fascinated with the protagonist in <em>My Side of the Mountain</em> &mdash; the idea of this boy living in the woods fending for himself, scavenging berries and tanning leather and hunting for venison (and tending to his own pet <em>falcon</em> &mdash; now that was frickin cool).</p>

<p>A memory circa 1998: my family is skiing at Yosemite and I&rsquo;m tired. I ask my Dad if I can go back by myself &mdash; the shuttle bus will be an hour ride down to the Valley floor. I must have been twelve, max. It is snowing heavily. He hands me the keys tells me to go ahead, and I make that ride back down myself. That day I feel like I&rsquo;ve crossed a threshold.</p>

<p>These days there are places in my life where I can say &mdash; I&rsquo;m going to be wild. <em>I&rsquo;m going to fight for this</em>, or <em>I&rsquo;m going to figure this out</em>. I&rsquo;m going to do this because as a grown man, I still want to run, and explore, and give it a good try.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-15T11:17:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://andrewhao.github.io/andrewhao/blog/2012/07/15/golden-gate-tri-recap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of last month, Nate, Bruce and I did the <a href="http://trifreaks.com/golden-gate-triathlon/">Golden Gate Triathlon</a> together. This was only my second triathlon ever (after last year&rsquo;s <a href="http://onyourmarkevents.com/TriForFuninfo.htm">Tri for Fun</a>), and I intended to train hard for this sucker.</p>

<p>Given my plantar fasciitis, this was slow going. Fortunately, this gave me a lot of opportunities to focus on bike and swim: long bike rides with the Regen cycling crew, open water swims with Nate in Alameda and Jeff every week in the DeFremery and Lions pools.</p>

<p>The course was: 0.93 mile loop a little off the Crissy Field beach. Then an epic 25 mile bike ride up and down from the Crissy Field Warming Hut lot, up over the Golden Gate Bridge parking lot entrance and down Lincoln (past an __epic view of the coast) and then back &mdash; six times. Finally, a 6 mile run out and back over the Golden Gate Bridge. It goes without saying that the views were generally epic.</p>

<h2>Swim</h2>

<p>We huddled up by the beach and listened to the race director describe the course. Two loops around three buoys.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576017804/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7576017804_d7abb3047d.jpg" alt="Prepping for the swim" /></a> This photographer knew what s/he was doing.[/caption]</p>

<p>Wetsuit: I got a month rental at Sports Basement in early June. That sucker chafed at my neck a LOT. Remember next time to Body Glide it up. I was surprised at how buoyant the suit was. I also need to work on my swim technique. I pop up too often to look, when I could keep my head down and do a few more strokes before I take another look.</p>

<p>The plot got interesting when we saw the first wave of women jump into the water and start their wave. Within seconds, they started drifting sideways &mdash; <em>really</em> drifting &mdash; and fighting the current. I thought nothing about it, figuring that&rsquo;s just how it is when you swim open water.</p>

<p>But no, when I got in it was frickin <em>tough</em>. I rounded the first buoy, keeping up at the end of the pack when we turned the corner and bam. Treadmill status. I paddled for what I thought was ten minutes, and noticed that I had basically moved 10 feet. <em>What?</em></p>

<p>So I panicked a little. And then had to calm myself down by reminding myself two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> You won&rsquo;t drown.</p></li>
<li><p> You&rsquo;re strong enough</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I figured I needed to swim harder and started to kick a bit more and kind of mentally prepared myself to dig in and be swimming for an hour or so. But by then I had fallen <em>really</em> far behind (I&rsquo;m not that strong of a swimmer) and I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out the target buoy in the distance because I was staring into the sun.</p>

<p>Then another swimmer grabbed me and yelled for me to go back to shore. &ldquo;They cancelled the swim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I really just felt relief. Upon hitting shore folks were kind of in a daze, confused. Some were sprinting for the T1 station, so I kind of jogged on over. The tri had just become a duathlon.</p>

<p>I checked my watch and realized I had been in the water for 32 minutes and hadn&rsquo;t even made it halfway around the first lap. So good thing they cancelled the swim. I woulda been out there for a <em>long</em> time.</p>

<p>I had a horrible T1. I figured before the race I was just gonna strip the wetsuit and throw on my bike jersey. No way. Skin&rsquo;s too wet. I fought with my jersey for a couple of minutes as Bruce and Nate blew on past me. Ugh. Finally I got my jersey on and I was on my way.</p>

<h2>Bike</h2>

<p>I figured I was an okay biker, but I had made a mistake and gone on a workout the morning prior to race day. I&rsquo;d normally never do this on race day, but I figured somehow that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>But the course hurt a <em>lot</em> more than I&rsquo;d anticipated. If you weren&rsquo;t zooming down a hill, you were climbing one. There were next to no flats. And it was a bit mentally taxing keeping a count of the lap you were doing in your head. I half expected to either ride one too little or one too many laps.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576018872/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8285/7576018872_c8f37cf8e5.jpg" alt="Bike descent" /></a></p>

<p>It was kind of fun riding a loop course though. And the view down Lincoln was epic as usual. Every time I&rsquo;d pass Nate going opposite directions I&rsquo;d give him a little grunt of encouragement. Next time I&rsquo;m gonna have to catch him so I can ride with him.</p>

<p>I finished the bike ride at 1:43:14.</p>

<p>25 miles later we hit T2 and I threw on my shoes and was outta there&hellip;</p>

<h2>Run</h2>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;333&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576018688/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7576018688_6cb0064d91.jpg" alt="Hurting" /></a> Rocking $1 Wayfarers.[/caption]</p>

<p>I was both the most confident and the most shaky about the run. Running&rsquo;s my strength, and I knew I could crank out a 10K pretty well. But I hadn&rsquo;t run over 4 miles on a workout in months. I&rsquo;d have to trust my general cardio training on the bike to sustain me for the run.</p>

<p>We looped Crissy Field and headed up to the bridge. I didn&rsquo;t feel as much quad burn as I noticed after my first tri. I actually stopped to use the john halfway up&hellip; I drank too much on the bike!</p>

<p>I felt great on the steps going up &mdash; taking them two at a time and generally feeling springy. We hit the bridge and it became a game of catch-the-next-guy and dodge-the-tourists. There was a lot of dodging (and I nearly had a couple of close calls with unwary tourists). I felt really good dropping runners though.</p>

<p>One crazy thing happened &mdash; the runners went through a low tunnel on the way up. The girl running ahead of me smacked her head on the top of the tunnel and flew backwards and landed on her back. We stopped and grabbed medical help for her &mdash; there was a good amount of blood and it could have been bad. She was conscious though and able to talk through it though. Scary.</p>

<p>I finished the run in 43:46. Which is 7:04/mi pace, including a pee break and a quick detour to grab a course volunteer. Awesome.</p>

<h2>End</h2>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;333&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576019766/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8293/7576019766_89d9705106.jpg" alt="Done." /></a> Done, done, and done.[/caption]</p>

<p>I finished with an overall time of 2:28:20, placing me 10th in the race and 2nd in the Male 30-39 division (sweet! Also: they had registered me at 36 years old :D). Nate edged me out by 39 seconds at 2:27:41, and Bruce finished with a respectable 2:58.</p>

<p>Afterwards we enjoyed the postrace glow with a lot of peanut butter jelly sandwiches (glory!). And Clif bars. Then I found a cafe and had a big mocha. And took a fat nap.</p>

<p>Sweet! So I&rsquo;ve still not technically finished an Olympic-distance race, but maybe that&rsquo;ll be next time. All in all, I&rsquo;m happy with my performance, especially on the run.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>I&rsquo;m not afraid of dying</em>. I&rsquo;m surprised by the thought flitting across my mind as my plane takes off. Were we to plunge into the California coast as the scene used to play out in my imagination, I&rsquo;d be ready for that.</p>

<p>I had a backwards-sort of feeling tonight as I entered the airport, breezing through the security lines and arriving at my gate much too early. Justin and Frank had dropped me off and gone to In &lsquo;n Out without me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going home to Pasadena. Or rather, I&rsquo;m going to see my family in Pasadena, with Annie&rsquo;s graduation being the reason for celebration. Going home means something different these days. Is it the house you grew up in? Is about seeing your family, your friends? Is it neon-lit boba shops, or the wideness of De Anza Boulevard or Calabasas Park with the ghost stories or the panicky feeling of waking up realizing you&rsquo;ve overslept first period or junior or senior prom from howlongago&mdash; and the exhilaration of pulling off a spectacular field show or the happy sensation of rolling up to a full dining table exploding with Taiwanese foods? Yes, yes, and yes.</p>

<p>I have a memory where I am dropping off my parents at SFO. They are leaving for China, my sisters are still undergrads in San Diego. I am seeing Sarah at the time; she stands to my left as we wave our good-byes to them from across the glassed security walls. And that&rsquo;s when it hits, a sudden blue-ness, a feeling of being gone, or that finally, I am on my own. I wonder if that&rsquo;s what it feels like to be grown-up. All the older folks in Stephen Ministry tell about loved ones passing away, spouses divorcing, buddies moving across the country for a job, or spouse, or to take care of a relative. It&rsquo;s a fact (it&rsquo;s so true that you may surprise yourself because you don&rsquo;t understand it yet), the people you grow to treasure and love will leave you, and that leaving-ness is a sensation that startled me that day. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just as true that I was unique in experiencing it so late in my life.</p>

<p>In that memory, we duck in to the Sharper Image store to play with the massage chairs. The rollers playfully tug and push and pull at my calves and lower back, and I stare hard at the remote, squirming, barely making out the buttons, fighting back stupid tears. Hold it together man. C&#8217;mon, I&rsquo;m self-talking. Pull yourself together.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s a backward feeling because tonight I&rsquo;m flying home to my family. I am excited to see everybody again. I&rsquo;m proud of my sister. I&rsquo;m glad to get out of Oakland. I&rsquo;m feeling a bit more courageous. It merely took time.</p>

<p>Later on the plane, I&rsquo;m dozing off when another memory startles me: Shortly after my dad gave me my first computer somewhere in the fifth grade, I convinced my mom to buy me a word processor to install on it. I was a bookish kid then (thankfully!), and always had my nose buried in a novel. I had just finished reading some Crichton book&mdash;<em>Airframe</em> I believe&mdash;and wrote a story basically verbatim from the book about a plane crashing in the Pacific. In it, I describe in painstaking detail the panic of the passengers, the luggage flying about the compartment, the sound the latches made when they flipped open, what exactly the pilot would say into the intercom&hellip; which was whatever Mr. Crichton would have said in his novel. I titled the piece <em>The Final Flight of Flight 738</em> or something equally dramatic to an eleven-year-old. But the most clear part of the memory was when my dad saw that I was writing something that Saturday morning: I saw a blend of curiosity and pride light up his face. &ldquo;Here. Let me see it,&rdquo; he had said, moving toward me, reaching for the printout in my hands.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>I can run!</em> I&rsquo;m on a jog on my lunch break for the first time in four months, and I want to tell it to everyone: tourists with itchy, sunstroked faces crowding Chinatown, Dan, down-cast on the street corner in front of that handmade sushi roll place, forty-something yuppies with yoga mats yelping as I dodge them by. I&rsquo;m drinking it in, the clangs of cable-car bells, the way they fade off when the car heads up the hill on California, the way the riders have a faraway look as if they&rsquo;ve seen something familiar yet mysterious (maybe it&rsquo;s warm nostalgia for things they can&rsquo;t remember).</p>

<p>Everything is beautiful: the way the buttery spires on Saints Peter &amp; Paul church melt into the sky. The easy spring in my stride, which surprises me. The pleasant shade of laurel trees on Jackson, set against Telegraph Hill. I have to hold myself back from racing other runners down the Embarcadero because I&rsquo;m liable to hurt myself again. But I race them anyways. <em>I can run! </em>I sing a song in my head; it is a simple one for which I&rsquo;ve forgotten the verse but not the refrain: <em>he who began a good work in you / will be faithful to complete it</em>. And so it goes.</p>

<p>Four miles in, I lope to the center of the divide in front of the Ferry Building and stretch below the sculpture in its center, noticing a small twinge in my heel. Easy now, I tell myself. Don&rsquo;t let it get to your head. But the endorphins take over and I feel light again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel like seasons are changing, not just in the air but through my life. I&rsquo;m outdoors more often, laughing more, more <em>okay</em> with things being stuck, or in-between, or just not formed yet.</p>

<p>The plantar fasciitis is still there, and not being able to run has been frustrating to say the least, but I&rsquo;ve been enjoying bike rides and swims. Summer is in the air, and a part of me is stretching and yawning and settling in to it. One of my favorite feelings is being at home with friends on a warm evening with the windows open, full after a shared meal, listening to a George Strait song and chatting about whatever. Those nights I go to bed and think to myself, <em>I&rsquo;m happy. God is good. I have been given much.</em></p>

<p>I thought the same thing about my family&hellip; we Skyped for a bit last week and I wonder why I&rsquo;m not more in touch with them more often when there&rsquo;s clearly a lot of love between us. I have been given much. And this is kind of awkward because they all read this blog (hi Mom!).</p>
