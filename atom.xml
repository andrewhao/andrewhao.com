    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Driving back up on the 5, I heard a song erupting in the meadows. The windows were down and the air was heavy with the scent of wildflowers. I&rsquo;d been driving long, winding single lane country roads for forty miles, these long expanses of California farmland, green as far as the eye could see. And I swear, I could have heard singing.</p>

<p>What did I do to deserve this? I&rsquo;m moved into West LA now &ndash; not far from the hustle of Hollywood, the glamour of Beverly Hills. I confess I tried to avoid it at first, wishing to be home most of the time and bracing myself for the slog of the I-10, the oppressive desert heat. And yet&hellip;</p>

<p>To my surprise, I&rsquo;ve found bits and pieces of home here. Wandering, meandering hills. Cool mornings (at least in coastal Santa Monica). A workplace that I enjoy, and coworkers I really, really like. And the cherry on top: I&rsquo;m able to bike everywhere.</p>

<p>There is a sense of release here. I&rsquo;m starting over new, and for someone who loves to feel planted and rooted, it&rsquo;s a little disorienting at first. But with the openness of space and time, I&rsquo;m finding that this is the right place for me to be right now.</p>

<p>I look forward to meeting Annie after her classes, catching up over the day, sharing a meal and a boba drink (or two). I like watching her scrunch her nose and hearing her talk about her students. Debating in the car over the merits of Kendrick Lamar and Tupac, or the politics of education. Or maybe, to a lesser degree, the absolute freedom to be silly and let dumb remarks fly.</p>

<p>I enjoy early morning runs with various running groups here; learning the landscape and its topography. I like feeling strong climbing a ridge or opening the throttle down San Vicente Boulevard.</p>

<p>I like that as I&rsquo;m preparing for a life together with Annie, I only get a stronger sense that I am seen and accepted.</p>

<p>I wish this place felt like home, and I&rsquo;m still slightly in between two places. Home is Oakland and the Regeneration family, or home is being with my sisters and parents, or home is with Annie, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

    <link href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2014/10/01/a-way-to-move/"/>

    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2014/10/01/a-way-to-move</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh my God, I&rsquo;m cold. I guess I didn&rsquo;t imagine this on my retreat.
30MPH gusts blowing at me, stinging my face with snow bits. Nature is beautiful yet harsh, and I
realize that the City Boy in me is not quite cut out for this. We aren&rsquo;t
in Oakland any more.</p>

<p>Nobody is on this snow-covered trail. I am following moose tracks some ways in the
distance. I imagine it ambling toward me, at some earlier point in the
morning. Is it a moose? Or a horse? Paw prints emerge in the snow a bit
further on, and I wonder if there are mountain lions nearby.</p>

<p>That morning I drove up to Lake Brainard and was met with blasting winds
coming over the mountain pass. I changed my mind, <em>screw this</em>, and I
jumped back into the car and drove a few miles down the road, figuring
that I&rsquo;d take a couple of miles of hiking in the forest to warm up before navigating through the lower lake.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/15438591602"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5601/15438591602_eb9f37844c_b.jpg" alt="Lake Isabelle" /></a></p>

<p>Three hours and a mere six miles later, I&rsquo;m at
Lake Isabelle, a frosty, glassy-blued alpine lake, and the sun has just
begun to warm me. Alas, the gusts are still there. I see two men make
their way up on the trail pass above, their voices echoing off the
mountain walls. The snow somehow makes their voices travel further, or
I&rsquo;m really desperate for human contact.</p>

<p>I think of all the hikes I&rsquo;ve taken with friends in the past and for a
moment, desperately wish they were here, just so I could stop feeling so
lonely, or to have some conversation to keep my mind turning.</p>

<p>Annie asked me the other day
what I think about when I&rsquo;m running. Sometimes I&rsquo;m singing a song in my
head, or other times I&rsquo;m just picturing me entering the next trail. At
the moment, I&rsquo;m envisioning how warm the car is and how good the bed is
going to feel. I&rsquo;ve been turning over a phrase in my head for the past
couple of days: &ldquo;A new way to be human.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a line from a Switchfoot
song, and I have a suspicion that it has some significance for me here.</p>

<p>I meet more
backpackers coming back the other way: <em>High winds, no visibility, we&rsquo;re
turning around</em>. I make mental notes to go as far as I can, and realize
that honestly, I have no idea how I will know. Is it fear? Is it
physical tiredness?</p>

<p>In the end, I turn around because I&rsquo;m cold.</p>

<p>The clouds are getting
darker and the gusts are biting more fiercely. I arrive at a snowy field at 12000 feet and look up. The
next climb is totally shrouded in a dark cloud. Two men are hurriedly
making their way down from the top. I shiver. Let&rsquo;s go home.</p>

<p>This solo retreat is exactly rooting
out the things I want and love. I desire the warmth of friendship, the
experience of beauty, the purpose of a journey. I did come here to be
alone, but I did also come here to find a new way to move and be human.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Push and pull, move and wait. I&rsquo;m in a season of waiting, of settling down. One moment moving, one moment heads-down dealing with the day-to-day, one moment being allowed (a little) to plan and to dream.</p>

<p>I guess I never really thought about what it would look like to be here, in my late 20&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve always had a hazy vision about what it might look like, but I never expected to feel so <em>young</em>, or feel so unsure, or simultaneously sure. I have my moments when I think to myself dude, I&rsquo;ve lived it up so far. And other seasons I&rsquo;m wondering <em>ok, so now what&rsquo;s the next step?</em></p>

<p>I think this is where Annie and I are different &mdash; she loves the experience of the new, and so lives her life at the place of risk, discomfort, and new experiences. I love the comfort of familiarity, loving the feeling of mastery and the deepening of purpose and relationship.</p>

<p>I love the feeling of running, and the mastery of achieving a PR, or new distance goal. Or I love the feeling of deepening my knowledge or technique around a programming methodology or principle, refining and creating.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m learning that I&rsquo;m scared too, to live at the razor&rsquo;s edge of risk. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m learning to do recently. To make a move, to try to put myself out there again to change things up. To see what&rsquo;s outside of myself. Who knows what I&rsquo;ll find?</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how Annie and I will do with the reality of her grad school looming in the horizon. Of course, I&rsquo;m unsure about how long distance will play out with us. But as much as I hate the uncertainty, and I&rsquo;m anxious about the future, and how much I hate having conficts or feeling misunderstood, I feel like I can trust myself and trust my gut. You&rsquo;ve lived long enough to know this. Trust your gut. Trust in your father. There are Good things ahead.</p>

    <link href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2014/01/01/a-letter-to-paris/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-01T18:04:46-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2014/01/01/a-letter-to-paris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Paris, I confess I don’t really get you. I mean, it’s amazing being here,
walking your cobblestone streets, taking in the sights and sounds. Your
language is beautiful, melodic, and silky, so much so that I’m
embarrassed when I try to speak it — the words kind of slip out of my
mouth and I lower my voice to avoid the embarrassment of
mispronunciation (several people have assumed that I’ve simply grunted,
and for some reason my face has flushed red).</p>

<p>You know, I don’t appreciate being hawked at, or grabbed by the hand,
trinkets pushed into my hand. I looked up from my phone once and walked
past a few of your street vendors when I felt two hands on my wrists,
and in a panic I pushed them off and stuffed my phone into my pocket and
felt a hot flash of anger and annoyance. Don’t touch me. I guess I
thought I was going to be robbed, more of an instinct. Obviously I
wasn’t, but that put me in a sour mood for a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>I think I understand why Parisiennes don’t claim to love Americans —
it’s because Americans like me don’t even try to learn your language.
I’ve imagined them all thinking in their heads as I stand with them in
silence in an elevator, or wordlessly jab my finger at a croissant in a
window, “Why does he not speak our language? Why can’t he even say ‘one
croissant, please?’”? I’m making it up in my mind, of course, but I’m
caught off guard in the moment that I have no idea how to say it, and
that it never even crossed my mind to figure out how.</p>

<p>On the crowded subway train in from the airport a couple days ago, I
reached down to pull up my luggage. We were packed in, neck to neck,
breathing down each others’ necks. The African lady standing directly in
front of me said something in French — something stern, I gathered — and
I panicked because the words meant nothing to me, and I was, for once,
the dumb one, the mute one. I mumbled (or grunted), then dropped my bag
and decided against pulling it up.</p>

<p>Later on, I figured out what she said: “The train door opens on that
side.”</p>

<p>It’s rained much here for the few days that we’re here — and as we walk
around I’ve seen several girls that are on the verge of tears. One was
looking gloomily out a subway train window. Another was walking
hand-in-hand with another man, her eyes about to pour. What happened to
them? Are they melancholy because of the weather? Is the chilly air
drying out their contacts? What are they thinking? Did their
superhandsome French boyfriends break up with them? What is exactly so
romantic about this place?</p>

<p>We walk and roam your streets and find, to our dismay, the majority of
shops and plazas shut down for the New Years’ festivities. It wasn’t so
disappointing the first time, but on the third or fourth time you visit
some place only to see shuttered doors, it can be a bit of a blow. My
dad suggests we go someplace to eat, and we don’t do too poorly on our
share of baguettes, crepes, omelettes, and waffles.</p>

<p>Here I feel a strong aversion to the mobs and New Years’ partygoers. All
I really want to find is a small cafe in a quiet part of town and sit
down with a good book or a laptop to get some coding done (I’m a nerd
like that). The first was found in a rainy maze outside the Royal Palace
— I had a cappuccino and sat by a long, foggy window and watched
tourists pour out of the building, dodging rain. The second was a tiny
shop I swear you could have found in the Mission, or somewhere in
Brooklyn: young hipsters crowded around little tables, artisan,
single-origin coffee being ground, the aromatic oils blooming to fill
the entire cafe. Ah.</p>

<p>But really, Paris, you won me over tonight. It wasn’t really anything
that you had done, but it was a moment I had by myself on a short jog
along the canal. I crossed over your bridges and there, at the top of
one, I realized something. Maybe it was the eerie quiet and calm you had
— you, a city of 2 million! — and the streetlights reflecting over the
water. I stood and realized that I want to come back again. Maybe
there’s a reason why people affix locks to your bridges, in hopes that a
part of them is tied to you so they may return. It had stopped raining;
I could find no slice of the moon. A couple murmured beneath a dimmed
shop window. My heart was still pounding; my breath short. Paris, I’m
hoping that I’ll be back soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Steep Ravine 50K</h3>

<p>I opened the new year with a 50K warmup in mind for April&rsquo;s American
River 50, so I signed up to run Steep Ravine, which was a nice romp
through Stinson Beach up to the top of Mt. Tam. Justin, Nate, and Pete
joined.</p>

<p>Well seven miles in, up over Cardiac Hill on the descent, I hit a patch
of rocky decline where I descended a little too recklessly and twisted
my ankle. Ouch. Well that was the end of that, but at least I got to
chill out on Cardiac Hill with some good buddies.</p>

<p>After that, I switched shoes to train in Hokas, which are a completely
different beast of a shoe. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write more on that another time&hellip;</p>

<h3>RBO 2013</h3>

<p>I had an awesome string of Saturdays training alongside these Oakland youth.
Samuel, a kid I ran with, finished the half with no problems. Sometimes I forget
what a freakin&#8217; awesome achievement that is. <a href="http://andrewhao.com/2013/04/27/finishing-what-we-started/">The kids inspire me.</a></p>

<h3>AR50 training</h3>

<p>This being my first 50, I took the training pretty seriously once I was
back on my feet. I ran everywhere I could, and that meant a lot of time
in the Oakland Hills and Marin County.</p>

<h3>Pacing Nate</h3>

<p>Nate ran a couple of 100 milers this year like they were no big deal. A
big highlight was being able to pace him for a leg or two at those
races. Here&rsquo;s him at Western States:</p>

<p>And again in September, at the Wasatch Front 100:</p>

<h3>American River 50</h3>

<p>April came and it was time to run the AR50. Known as one of the more
forgiving 50 milers, it takes runners from Sacramento down to Auburn.</p>

<p>I drove up to Sacramento with Annie, Justin and Nate for the first leg.
Here, pre-race donut nutrition is to be had:</p>

<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/150777_10101995134705863_132076418_n.jpg" alt="5AM
Coffee" /></p>

<p>Took it easy from the start &mdash; the saying goes that you start an ultra
slow, then you get slower.</p>

<p>We started at 5AM, and I reigned myself in a lot. I knew I had Nate and
Justin waiting for me at the marathon point, so I had that to keep my
spirits up. We ran mostly along the banks of the American River for the
first half, where I kept pretty consistent 10:00/mi marks up to the
halfway point.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/11673891093_accd6a08a9_o.jpg" alt="At the halfway mark" /></p>

<p>&hellip;where I was joined by Nate as my pacer.</p>

<p>Super beautiful out there. The course at this point got much narrower
and scenic as we ran the singletrack around Folsom Lake:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3782/11673645395_5d7b1e8f47_o.jpg" alt="Folsom Lake" /></p>

<p>Right around mile 40, where Justin met me, I started feeling it a
little. The race had been good; no big spasms or cramps or anything, but
I started feeling the fatigue set in. Justin was a big help in talking
to me and keeping my spirits up.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/11672280313_f911d22f1b_c.jpg" alt="Justin and me" /></p>

<p>Finally it was the dreaded two mile climb to the finish.. around 1400
feet in 2 miles. Strangely enough I felt strong enough to push it hard
and go hard. The thought that it was such a beautiful day and there were
so many good things about this race made something bubble a bit inside
of me.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/11674429516_9268d37212_o.jpg" alt="Happy" /></p>

<p>I finished strong, at 8:43, good enough to put me 100th overall.</p>

<p><img src="https://scontent-a-cdg.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/522127_10101995133573133_603957306_n.jpg" alt="Aftermath" /></p>

<p>Afterwards, I felt a little tired. Just a little fried. Speaking of fries, we
drove home happy, grabbed some Chik-Fil-A in Folsom, and I took a good,
long nap.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do this again.</p>

<h3>Golden Gate Triathlon</h3>

<p>On the heels of <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/07/15/golden-gate-tri-recap/">last year&rsquo;s triathlon</a>, I decided to give it a once-more, since last year the swim was cancelled. So training for the tri dovetailed nicely with the tapering of trail running &mdash; I got back into the pool, and jumped back onto the bike for swims and rides.</p>

<p>Well come race day, all I can say is this: I was less prepared than I
thought I was, but heck, I think I was about as prepared as I was
prepared to give. My goal was to just enjoy the race, have a good time,
and hope that my run fitness was enough to carry me through the
Olympic-distance course.</p>

<h4>Swim</h4>

<p>Well this was the biggest X-factor, since I&rsquo;d never actually
successfully completed a Olympic distance open water swim. I was just
mostly afraid of last year&rsquo;s scenario again, and had images of waves
pulling me out to sea (freaky, to say the least). Fortunately, this
didn&rsquo;t happen. I swam slowly but surely, the course was changed to be
closer to shore and more forgiving, and I came out fine.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3795/11674865983_946b917eb0_z.jpg" alt="Jumping out of the water" /></p>

<p>Next was the bike, which was like a punch in the gut. I had forgotten
how demanding this course was, with fourteen climbs on Lincoln Ave for
4000&#8217; of gain&hellip; this was gonna be no walk in the park.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/11674623485_ae88c0d9ab_z.jpg" alt="Yeah, this sucked" /></p>

<p>So with thighs and hamstrings burning, I pulled into T2 with just enough
gas to limp out slowly and get slowwwwly adjusted into run mode.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I had very little left in the tank &mdash; much less than I
felt I had last year to put up a good run over the bridge. My quads felt
like dead weights and my hamstrings protested the whole time.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3712/11674623335_8508fca943_z.jpg" alt="Crossing the finish" /></p>

<p>And so it was &mdash; I had completed the sucker (in 3:31) with zero style at an unimpressive pace.
It wasn&rsquo;t exactly the kind of race I was hoping for, but hey, I had
finally finished the real thing, the whole thing. And that was gonna be good enough.</p>

<h3>Marin Century</h3>

<p>Another one of my goals this year was to finish a century ride, of which
I had <em>trained</em> for last year but never got to see to completion due to
a schedule conflict. So I enrolled myself and figured this would be my
running offseason &mdash; and I got to go on some pretty badass rides.</p>

<p>Anyways, the race was beautiful. I ended up riding it alone, which was
nice because I got some good time in to myself, but I caught myself
wishing I had a riding buddy to talk to.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2891/11672187815_e15058639b_c.jpg" alt="Breaking through the clouds" /></p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/11672432803_0189f4c79e_c.jpg" alt="Above the
clouds" /></p>

<p>Zomg. It was gorgeous at the top of Mt. Tam. However, the ride down through
Muir Woods to the coast was <em>freezing</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2831/11672972476_b24e1297de_c.jpg" alt="A little band of bikers" /></p>

<p>At around mile 60 or so, I was gassing. I&rsquo;ve never been much of a
cyclist, but I was surprised I was so fatigued &mdash; maybe it was riding
along the coast and getting buffeted by the winds and being a terrible
climber&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7313/11672552824_813c11b4a1_z.jpg" alt="This smile is deceiving" /></p>

<p>It got <em>so</em> much better when I hit Point Reyes. I didn&rsquo;t care, cuz I had a chocolate croissant (ok, more like two). I was happy.</p>

<p>The last 15 miles or so were pretty flat, so I cruised on down to the
finish line. Bells rung. The aroma of pizza and burritos filled the air.
I sat down to another biker who swapped stories with me, told me he was
waiting for his girlfriend to finish the Mt. Tam climb, and told me,
with a grin, to find him on Strava.</p>

<p>I never did, but I&rsquo;ll be back riding soon.</p>

<h3>Ramping up (and down) for TNF 50</h3>

<p>Autumn came, and Eric, Allie, myself, Nate and Yusef had begun running all
sorts of bandit runs in the woods, up in the hills, at weird, odd hours
in the morning and night. We did see some pretty beautiful stuff:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7434/11672809285_807c3d9d2d_c.jpg" alt="Mt Tam" /></p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/11672782045_7d1a32bc90_c.jpg" alt="Redwood Park" /></p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7303/11673542356_3d0922d0f7_c.jpg" alt="Coastal Trail" /></p>

<p>However, something happened to Allie, Eric and myself: we, all sometime
in the same week or so, managed to get hurt in our own ways. Maybe it
was the intensity of training we ramped up with. In any case, it was a
bummer &mdash; my specific case was a bout with patellar tendinitis that,
come December, I had to admit defeat and not run the North Face race.</p>

<p>We did manage, however, to volunteer and pace Yusef at the TNF 50 race,
and it was a beautiful, chilly December race day.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5534/11673131783_01cf7424fa_b.jpg" alt="Yusef gives a thumbs-up" /></p>

<p>That just about does it. Happy trails to come in 2014!</p>

    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2013/12/28/on-changing-moving-and-finding-momentum</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To be honest? This year felt a little like autopilot. Like I was caught
dealing with <em>Life</em> as it happened, doing a zillion different things
(like I always do) and realizing that I needed to catch up with the
changes. At times, this year felt like waiting for things to happen to me.
Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Life is all about changes. Friends move away, jobs change, roles morph, and I found
myself wondering on more than one occasion &mdash; what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling like I&rsquo;m being constantly faced with the struggle &mdash; how can
I change? How can I grow? Where it feels like sometimes my friends are
moving forward with their lives, there was a bit of soul-searching to be
done this year &mdash; what am I doing nowadays? Is there something I need to
be doing to grow and move forward?</p>

<p>Not much has changed in my life in the outside this year. I still work
at the same place. I&rsquo;m in the same community, and my friends are still
the same. Things are pretty good, and pretty stable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a creature of habit, and it takes a lot of external forces to make
me move. I don&rsquo;t like to travel (too much), preferring a trail run or a
good read or some heads-down coding time. I&rsquo;m a homebody, and I&rsquo;d much
rather spend my vacation time just relaxing at a nearby cafe. I&rsquo;ve eaten
oatmeal for breakfast, coffee in the morning, and lentils for dinner
wayyy too many times to count, (and gotten a lot of grief for it :) ).</p>

<p>But when do these habits start getting in the way of growth, or others&#8217;
growth? I&rsquo;ve learned that I have much to grow in my leadership. My
tendency is to focus way too much on the detail and not enough in the
strategy and vision. If you&rsquo;ve asked me what I was going to do two years
in the future, I&rsquo;d honestly have trouble telling you what that would be.</p>

<p>I wrestle with delegation, and sometimes I find myself in roles that
aren&rsquo;t fit for me anymore and not quite keeping up with my own growth.</p>

<p>So one of my hopes in my growth this year is to acknowledge change and
embrace transition and, hell, maybe even lean into some changes of my
own. At time of writing, I have no idea what that may mean, but the
thought is exciting and unappetizing and terrifying and that in itself
is probably a sign that that is What I Might Need. Maybe I need to go on
vacation more. Delegate more aggressively. Keep ruminating on long-term
dreams. Stuff like that. Yeah.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why I named this blog &ldquo;Finding Momentum&rdquo; so many years
ago &mdash; to crystallize a deep want to grow, adapt, and mature.</p>

    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2013/04/27/finishing-what-we-started</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing I like about volunteering with RBO is the chance to meet up with kids from all different parts of Oakland. This year I was paired up with S, a kid from the Fruitvale district attending a local charter school just a few blocks from me.</p>

<p>S is a soft kid, a quiet kid. He isn&rsquo;t quick to volunteer himself, so our runs consist of me talking a lot, or asking him questions, and him politely answering them.</p>

<p>Our worlds are different &mdash; I grew up in wealthy Saratoga, where our biggest concerns were about our GPAs, studying for the SATs, or when we&rsquo;d inherit our parents&#8217; cars. S grew up in the hood, where everybody around him is gang-affiliated. Every Saturday morning at seven he jumps on two buses and comes out to our workouts on the south end of the lake by himself.</p>

<p>His best friend is Z, a slender Mexican-American kid like S, who became fast friends at their current school. Z has already developed the qualities of a young ringleader &mdash; brash, handsome, funny, a friend of trouble, and still hesitant and vulnerable behind his persona in a way that thirteen-year olds are.</p>

<p>Our workouts together would consist of the two friends running together, and Z volunteering uninvited facts about his friend: &ldquo;Did you know that S is the handsomest guy at school. He&rsquo;s a player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>S: (chuckles to himself)</p>

<p>Z: &ldquo;Him and me stopped being friends because he was seeing this girl, and I told him that she was trouble but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Oh yeah? What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talk about her at length.</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the deal with you guys now? You&rsquo;re still friends right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Z: &ldquo;Yeah, I went away and wrote him a letter and said I still wanted to be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two weeks later S reports back to me: I&rsquo;ve broken up with that girl, Z was right.</p>

<p>And then he tells me he&rsquo;s dating someone else now, her friend. I laugh.</p>

<hr />

<p>What&rsquo;s it like when everyone around you is living a grit-filled life? When cop cars and sirens and gunshots are your common reality?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me and my sister are close&rdquo; S says, &ldquo;but she protects me&rdquo; &mdash; her sister was jumped into a gang two years ago (I am surprised to learn she is only 14).</p>

<p>They are close, but so far apart. S has resolved to keep his head up and out of gangs, but his sister is deep in gang life. They&rsquo;re close, they fight, yet they love each other. He tells a story of nearly getting jumped himself, but for the protests of his sister, was let go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you stay out of the gang scene?&rdquo; I ask him.</p>

<p>He shrugs. &ldquo;They kind of know you&rsquo;re so-and-so&rsquo;s sister, and won&rsquo;t bother you.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>On one of our runs, Z and S were running together when S blurts out, &ldquo;Z once made me swallow a staple&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? How did that happen?&rdquo; I ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He dared me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Z&rsquo;s eyes twinkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It got stuck in my throat and I got scared and I had to go to the hospital&rdquo;, S says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst part was at the hospital, when I had to talk to his mom.&rdquo; Z shudders. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hella scary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>S just laughs.</p>

<hr />

<p>On our Oakland Half Marathon run this year, S and I were running past the West Oakland entrance to the Port, and I was talking to him about all the things we could see if we went over the bridge &mdash; Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, the Crucible, Brown Sugar Kitchen. &ldquo;Have you seen those things before?&rdquo; I ask. He responds no.</p>

<p>A half mile passes in silence, and then he volunteers, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many things I haven&rsquo;t seen&hellip; it&rsquo;s tough to see past all the violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We run a bit more in silence.</p>

<hr />

<p>S and I run a steady, paced half marathon together, and you can see his spirits rise as he pushes through his pain to get across the finish line, tired and happy. Z is somewhere behind us, having cramped up but he finishes too. And I&rsquo;m overcome with pride for S and what he&rsquo;s fighting for in his life.</p>

<p><img alt="RBO @ the Oakland Running Festival" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8398/8687014789_9d7f600e8d.jpg" /></p>

<p>(Tired and happy.)</p>

    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2013/01/18/a-brother-a-daughter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mike calls me out of the blue.</p>

<p>I pick up the receiver to a sonic wave of grief. They shot my baby, he wails, they took my girl.</p>

<p>You loved her a lot, I offer, the words stumbling out of my mouth.</p>

<p>I loved her like my own.</p>

<p>Her daddy passed away in November. Harry. He helped me move into my apartment, put in the down payment&hellip; now he&rsquo;s gone.</p>

<p>Wailing, the sobs come in waves. Bubbling, snorting, sniffling. Mike is a mess.</p>

<p>Listen.</p>

<p>I took Jubrille shopping just last week to get boots. Right out here &mdash; that Skechers on Bancroft? Giovana didn&rsquo;t like this one pair that Jubrille really liked oh God oh god oh gawd oh god</p>

<p>Silence from time to time&hellip; hello? Silence. Hello?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still here.</p>

<p>She was the last of 2012&hellip; I wish I was the last of 2012. I&rsquo;m done, Drew, I&rsquo;m done. It hurts so bad. Why&rsquo;d they take my baby?</p>

<p>How&rsquo;s Belinda?</p>

<p>The sobbing continues. She&rsquo;s&hellip; bad, Drew. Belinda&rsquo;s doing bad. You gotta call her man.</p>

<p>Jabrille, Gabriel, Jabrille, Gabriel &mdash; like the angel. Here&rsquo;s her picture.</p>

<p>Mike shows a video to me from his phone, taking his time to swipe through about twenty different pictures. There the image is, her room, shadowy in the afternoon, the sun filtering through dark curtains. Graduation photos, bags from various stores taped to the walls &mdash; FOOT LOCKER, FOREVER 21, H&amp;M. There is the sound of Mike choking back tears. There is a man in the room too, his arms slouched over his knees, giving Mike &amp; camera a long look.</p>

<p>Be strong Mike for my mom and my sister. Pull yourself together. You can&rsquo;t cry.</p>

<p>Giovana is shut off. Won&rsquo;t talk. Can&rsquo;t blame her. Her dad just passed too. And now her sister&hellip;</p>

<p><em>At the farewell funeral I met Giovana, who looked a lot skinnier and wider-eyed than I had imagined her being. She was only a year older than her sister, and walked shyly around the mourners, talking in side glances with her high school friends who looked pained and out of place. Some of them were smiling &mdash; whether it was the incongruity of it all, or using humor to mask deep sadness, I didn&rsquo;t know.</em></p>

<p>The candlelight vigil was last week, but oh man. It&rsquo;s gonna rain, Mike says, I gotta get there and get the teddy bears in her room.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling out of place. The Kingpin owner comes over to our table. Mike says: you hear the news. They took my daughter. Shot over New Years. The shop owner comes over and clutches Mike&rsquo;s phone loosely. Yeah. He looks concerned, then hands the phone back to Mike.</p>

<p>Everywhere I go I see girls that look like Jabrille. I stop and look at them. The other week we came out here and she bought boots at Skechers here. Right here in Berkeley.</p>

<p>Belinda says now you gotta help me raise the girls. So I say to Giovana: first thing is you can&rsquo;t go outside. Don&rsquo;t hang out with your hoochie mama friends. And she didn&rsquo;t say nothing.</p>

<p>Over our table now Mike slides over to me an open newspaper, the SF Chronicle, opened to an article about Malala, Pakistani girl who got shot by the Taliban. Read this? he asks. So sad.</p>

<p>You gotta be strong, Mike. Wait till this all blows over. I gotta be strong. I gotta be strong for Belinda.</p>

<p><em>Jubrille&rsquo;s viewing was the first viewing I&rsquo;ve ever been at, and she looked&hellip; unnatural. Plastic. There used to be a soul in there. Mike would stand over the casket and kissed her on the forehead. Justin and I stood awkwardly and waited in line and paid our respects and then, feeling a bit of displacement, we sat down in the pews and let Mike sit behind us and rattle on about his plans for the obituary. The entire scene felt unreal. Children running around, crawling under the pews, laughing. Belinda, who I finally met, was nicely put together, chatting it up with loved ones. I&rsquo;d overdressed; I had thought to dress up, but felt self-conscious in my tie and nice shoes. Walking back to the van Justin remarked to me and nobody in particular, is it not crazy that this kind of thing happens in Oakland twice a week?</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Years have passed since I&rsquo;ve last written about Mike. I see him every once in awhile in Berkeley, still. I think about him from time to time &mdash; wonder how he&rsquo;s doing. I catch him out the corner of my eye the week before I leave for vacation, hanging around at Gypsy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Mike!&rdquo; I call back to him, and he turns around with a big grin on his face. The sidewalks are soaked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my birthday tomorrow&rdquo; he tells me, and I remember how close to Christmas it is.</p>

<p>We swap phone numbers. He&rsquo;s in possession of an Android phone now. &ldquo;How does this thing work?&rdquo; he asks and laughs to himself. He&rsquo;s showing me photos of himself, now taking classes at a culinary school in SF. Something about that seems incongruous to me and I chuckle inside&hellip; but Mike, well I believe he has the gumption and work ethic to pull it off. I tell him I owe him a birthday lunch, and we part ways.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Flash forward a couple of weeks, and it&rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the new year. I&rsquo;ve left on a run and Mike&rsquo;s left me a voice mail while on my run. I listen to it on the way back, and his voice is hollow, blue, grief-stricken. &ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; chokes the voice on the other end, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22288885/police-identify-girl-killed-oakland-shooting">they shot my baby girl</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>I look up the news article. Jubrille was 15 years old, wanted to be a teacher, and was on her way to the mall with her sister and another friend. The shooter was another teen.</p>

<p>OAKLAND &mdash; A pile of flowers, candles, teddy bears and farewell notes grew by the hour Monday afternoon on a quiet street in East Oakland, but they were little comfort to Mike Harris.</p>

<p>Harris, whose longtime family friend Jubrille Jordan, 15, was fatally shot at the site Sunday afternoon, was awash in tears as he surveyed the makeshift memorial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was my sweetheart. They killed my sweetheart,&rdquo; said Harris, a neatly dressed man in his 50s, as he wiped his eyes. &ldquo;What happened? I don&rsquo;t know, I don&#8217;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jubrille was Oakland&rsquo;s 12th child killed in 2012, and its 131st homicide victim in one of the city&rsquo;s deadliest years in recent memory.</p>

<p>&mdash;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/15-year-old-girl-gunned-down-in-Oakland-4158925.php#ixzz2HXjvynid">San Francisco Chronicle, &ldquo;15-year old girl gunned down in Oakland&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>She was also Oakland&rsquo;s final homicide of 2012. Mike picks up, and I barely make out his words through the sobs.</p>

    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2013/01/01/the-soul</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year!</p>

<p>Last night I spent a good amount of time looking back at my journal and saw a few threads that ran through last year:</p>

<p>If 2011 was a year of risk-taking, then 2012, I&rsquo;ve summed up, was a building year, a year to build a rhythm and establish a flow. It was a full year at Blurb, commuting back and forth from SF. Keeping up the same routine at Regen. Stephen Ministry on Mondays, Circuit training Tuesdays, Wednesday mornings with Jeff, home group on Thursdays, Saturday morning runs, Sundays with Betty. Routine and rhythm. It can be good for you.</p>

<p>Knowing who I am, building a flow can be something to settle into but the risk is that I can get too comfortable.  But I found myself up against the reality that your ideals often have a hard time matching up to your reality. So on a serious note, last year was also the first year that I felt like I was just&hellip; <em>coasting</em>. And it felt horrible, the thought and feeling that the kind of life I should have been living should be filled with more risk, more Jesus + his presence. I&rsquo;m learning that I can oftentimes fall into routine and forget myself and why I&rsquo;m here.</p>

<p>There was a season &mdash; I remember it well &mdash; last year when I sat down and wrote down everything I was feeling &mdash; frustration with my life, honest doubts about my purpose and my faith and a slew of questions for God or Jesus or whoever it was that was overseeing my life. Life in Christ is filled with <em>joy</em>, right? Then why wasn&rsquo;t I feeling it? I was tempted to give it all up again.</p>

<p>The intersection of your faith and your daily life can disconnect sometimes, and things had derailed for a long time before I noticed it. The cynicism was subtle, but would crawl into things and inner dialogues. It would rebel against pat answers I saw people giving around me, or the cultural disconnects I&rsquo;d see between the church and Real Life, and a broken world.</p>

<p>The burnout was palpable, but here&rsquo;s the thing: it was something that I didn&rsquo;t do anything about. I kept up the same routines, held the same smiles and had the same answers. But inside there was a gnawing question that reappears from time to time: what is real about my life? Where was that sense that the world is on the brink of something glorious that I felt so often when I was younger&mdash;when things had a surety about them, and answers were more black and white, and joy was real because you were laughing, too? What about the intersection of dirt &amp; the divine, miracles I used to see, or evidence of the supernatural? Where does that stuff just <em>go</em> when you&rsquo;ve lived without them for so long?</p>

<p>Talking to Jeff, I was reminded that the times I felt <em>alive</em> in Christ were the times I was taking risks. So a lot of last year was about asking myself &mdash; where am I going? Where are places I can grow and risks that I can take? And there were a few themes: living in Oakland, identifying with the broken, friendships and brothers, youth &amp; community, silence &amp; solitude.</p>

<p>To be honest, a lot of that has not materialized, and a lot of that were gushy ideas lacking structure and thought and a strong heart.</p>

<p>God, I want that for this year. I want more faith, more experiences of your grace. I want courage to fight for people I love and defend the things I believe in (and vice versa). I want to run toward conflict instead of away from it. I want a stronger, more compassionate heart, and I want to run with people that show that too. But I mainly want to sense your nearness and know you with the familiarity of a son.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-01T15:17:31-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2013/01/01/what-i-did-in-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Competitively, this was a good year. I <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/03/15/already-and-still-not-yet/">ran a 3:05 PR</a> at Napa (yay!), but missed Boston by seconds (argh).</p>

<p>I was <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/05/07/seasons-shift/">frustrated with my plantar fasciitis</a>, but that gave me an opportunity to go into the swim and the bike and there were a lot of good memories doing long bike rides: Mt. Diablo + Mt. Tam with Bruce and friends. I also learned to swim in open water! Did my first <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/07/15/golden-gate-tri-recap/">Olympic tri</a>, with a crazy current. Got a few friends to do a Tri for Fun. Come October, the PF began clearing out and I started hitting the trails again :)</p>

<p>2013 will be the year I attempt my first <a href="http://www.ar50mile.com/">50mi race</a>, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the training runs on the trails. I think I&rsquo;ll end up doing a half-Ironman in there somewhere. And perhaps another attempt at Boston in the fall. Nate&rsquo;s going to be training for Western States, and I figure if I run with that guy enough I should be in good shape&hellip;</p>

<p>2012 was the year I started getting serious about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/andrewhaophotography">photography</a>! I&rsquo;m finding that I&rsquo;m learning a lot more about the craft. Figuring out the technical details is important, but more than that, it&rsquo;s about working with subjects, making them feel at ease. It&rsquo;s about finding light and keeping your eyes open always and going with your gut. It&rsquo;s about taking risks and trying new poses and settings. Wedding-wise, it&rsquo;s about planning, preparation and being on your toes. I have a lot to learn still, and I&rsquo;m excited about 2013&rsquo;s new assignments.</p>

<p>Wejoinin was kind of on the back burner but Hsiu-Fan and I are nearing the completion of a Rails 3 upgrade. More on that soon on my <a href="http://www.g9labs.com">technical blog</a>.</p>

<p>I took trips to Portland, LA, and even South Carolina.</p>

<p>I went to more than a few weddings and saw quite a few friends get hitched. Congratulations!</p>

<p>And&hellip; I started dating again. The feeling&rsquo;s a little surreal, but I like her a lot :)</p>

    <id>http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/12/16/on-aliveness</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two themes running through my journal lately &mdash; one is of intense gratitude: about the things I&rsquo;ve been given and how much I didn&rsquo;t deserve them. They are filled with thankfulness about how things have unfurled with Annie. It&rsquo;s got a lot of awe and wonder at the beauty of the outdoors and the sheer awe of creation.</p>

<p>But its counterpart is written from a part of me that is uncomfortable with my comfort &mdash; feeling sometimes an almost-arrogance at how much I&rsquo;ve gotten things figured out or how much I&rsquo;ve learned or where I am in life. I think a part of myself senses a puffed-upness in my soul, or is wary of a front that I put up from time to time. It&rsquo;s a false self, tied up in schedules and enamored by Having It Together.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to put my finger on it, but it comes and goes with a sort of numbness to the Gospel that creeps up, accompanied with various flavors of cynicism. Thinking to myself that the times I felt God&#8217;s presence the most were the times when I was humbled the most and almost wanting to crawl back to that place again, if only to sense the closeness of my father.</p>

<p><em>Bankrupt</em>&hellip; maybe that&rsquo;s a word I&rsquo;m looking for. When I was humbled and begging for God&rsquo;s presence in my life. And now that I&rsquo;m in a place of plenty, there&rsquo;s that sense that I&rsquo;m looking into mirrors and still missing the real thing. Jesus, be near to me now. I want to know your voice. I want to know simple things to be important things, like iron friendships and unyielding brotherhood, like being a part of your movement, like seeing redemption and miracles and Grace rock people for good, like humble love that is beyond reproach or ridicule.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the recent theme of grace, maybe one of the reasons I really like country songs and the myths they tell is because you can feel the grit in the stories. Country protagonists live out their flaws fully (for better or worse) but there&rsquo;s always that redemptive thread.</p>

<p>Or maybe I just want to drive a pickup truck.</p>

<p>Onward:</p>

<p>A question worth exploring is: how does my identity as an Asian-American man affect my perception of grace (and my fascination with southern white culture)? Is it self-aware irony, a hipster thing? Does it say something about the dominant culture I live in? Does it reflect on my own view of Asian masculinity (or lack thereof)?</p>

<p>Topics for future discussion, but honestly, I do really just want a pickup truck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sitting at Coffee Society here back home,  journaling and feeling generally overwhelmed by God&rsquo;s goodness. I&rsquo;m not sure when I felt it, but it might have been yesterday&rsquo;s slow, rambling run through the foothills from pre-dawn dusk to midmorning cool, or experiencing the long-anticipated togetherness of a Thanksgiving meal. Or maybe it was just hanging with Annie over lunch and being able to feel like a big brother again, or that my dad just dropped a new iPhone in my lap&hellip; just like that. I&rsquo;m seeing movement in my life, and things feel like they&rsquo;re coming together. I just had the thought&hellip; I can&rsquo;t deserve much of this. Things shouldn&rsquo;t be this good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been realizing lately there&rsquo;s this dichotomy in how I see myself &mdash; on one hand, I have a very outside-in view of myself, painfully aware of others&#8217; perceptions of myself and always trying hard to do things that create a polished image (see: <a href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/typethree.asp#.ULA2NeOe_ls">Enneagram 3</a>, of which I&rsquo;m becoming increasingly convinced of). I can experience myself as a high-performer, a compassionate human, and generally rad dude.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other part of myself that&rsquo;s pretty painfully aware of my flaws and shortcomings. It knows my hiding places and how often I can retreat to them&hellip; the places in myself that I experience fears and insecurities.</p>

<p>The achiever in me lives in fear of failure, the sense that things can&rsquo;t always be this good and I can&rsquo;t enjoy good things because I&rsquo;m bound to eff things up, or the sneaking suspicion that something catastrophic is around the corner. The hidden places in me are always wary of being exposed, or worried that I won&rsquo;t live up to expectations (whose?).</p>

<p>The longer I live the more I&rsquo;m realizing that these two parts of myself are redeemed by the Gospel. In the Gospel I can acknowledge my imposter and broken self. In the Gospel I begin with the fact that I deserved no good gifts, but then I am given something truly Good. It grounds me and humbles me, and most of all it allows me to <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/01/14/foreword/">yield</a> and experience gifts for what they are&hellip; and allow myself to savor the significance of this delight: that I&rsquo;m simply his son, and he&rsquo;s a good Father to me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oakland, tonight I swam in your streets and felt the cool of your night. I think to myself how I feel strong when the pull stroke feels easy, and think to memorize the tones of the sky at dusk when I pull to the side for air &mdash; half the sky a fading incandescent red, the other a fluorescent blue. I find, for a few moments of grace that people shimmer with a quiet mystery when they&rsquo;re underwater, the light from the pool lamps refracting, flexing, arcing over their bodies. To you, Oakland, I feel a sense of sheepishness, I</p>

<p>confess it&rsquo;s taken me years to learn to love you and I realize it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m still guarded when I&rsquo;m around you. It&rsquo;s taken time to understand why the bus lady sings bluesfully to herself at the stop. She does not want your change, but she wants you to recognize her and see her, approach her and hold her. You too have a dual personality, you like your sister are hot and cold. Your people struggle up against each other and quarrel, I remember how Pancho would come back to our steps every night after we told him to leave&mdash;no disrespect, he insisted&mdash;but we&rsquo;d start up all over on the same note. You&rsquo;re my partna right? Right, I&rsquo;d say, knowing it to be the feeblest lie, and wondering if he was being facetious or if I was the most cynical man on earth. You&rsquo;re my partna. Push and pull, push and pull. Oakland, I realize I still don&rsquo;t</p>

<p>get you but I can&rsquo;t let that get me down, because I still sense the electric buzz in your veins, and I have that freeze frame photo of the shimmer during that swim. I still have the sensation of lingering night warmth from the soil after a hot day and the small-sensation I get standing under the expanse of your patchquilt sky.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco wraps me up with hot pumice breath and does not let go. She follows me with a sincerity that I cannot shake, offering the fruits of her cacophony as the throaty rumbling of cable cars, as the muted quarreling of European travelers, blue eyed children in tow, as azalea sunbursts lining the steps I jog each afternoon. She orchestrates the movements of ten thousand bicyclists. She punctuates the skies with glass ornaments and fighter-jet jewels. and lures in her prey with the offerings of raven gold parlayed over her streets. She charms me over then just as quickly, she turns</p>

<p>cold; suddenly I am colored frigid by blasts of air conditioning from cavernous parking garages, blown to and fro through alleyways. Her eyes darken by murky sea gales, and nighttime cools her zeal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I miss running barefoot &mdash; there was something about running with the spring in your step, pushing gingerly against the grass, feeling the strength of the stride move through your legs and through your toes that made you feel powerful, or free, or wild. When I first started early on, I always felt sore and achy at the bottom of my foot, like pinpricks lived there. We&rsquo;d joke that running the lake barefoot was safe&mdash;so long as you didn&rsquo;t step on the needles. A few times I felt a sharp pain and swore I did step on one&hellip; only to find out that I was fine. But as the calluses built, your stride adjusted and you would feel safer, and the stones wouldn&rsquo;t cut you anymore and you&rsquo;d run a little faster, leaning into the slicing chill, ignoring the numbness of running on wet grass on the north end of the lake and run home in darkness against the dotted glow of Lake Merritt&rsquo;s necklace.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had the thought where I wished I could have been more wild when I was younger. Maybe it&rsquo;d be kind of cool to grow up and live in some remote town in the forest. I&rsquo;d like to run freely in the dirt and swim in a few lakes. I would have liked to learn how to wrestle and gotten in fights and build forts and bruise a few more knees and kiss a few more girls. I&rsquo;d like to have known the strength in my back and courage in my heart.  I remember always being fascinated with the protagonist in <em>My Side of the Mountain</em> &mdash; the idea of this boy living in the woods fending for himself, scavenging berries and tanning leather and hunting for venison (and tending to his own pet <em>falcon</em> &mdash; now that was frickin cool).</p>

<p>A memory circa 1998: my family is skiing at Yosemite and I&rsquo;m tired. I ask my Dad if I can go back by myself &mdash; the shuttle bus will be an hour ride down to the Valley floor. I must have been twelve, max. It is snowing heavily. He hands me the keys tells me to go ahead, and I make that ride back down myself. That day I feel like I&rsquo;ve crossed a threshold.</p>

<p>These days there are places in my life where I can say &mdash; I&rsquo;m going to be wild. <em>I&rsquo;m going to fight for this</em>, or <em>I&rsquo;m going to figure this out</em>. I&rsquo;m going to do this because as a grown man, I still want to run, and explore, and give it a good try.</p>
