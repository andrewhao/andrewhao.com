  <div class="entry-content"><p>He slowly slurps his noodles in front of me, and I take him for a professor, an old man with a certain academic flair. Of course, I have no such reason for thinking so, he could be any old man at this nondescript, jam-packed hole-in-the-wall restaurant (the best kind). A sky-blue collared shirt hides beneath the neckline of his sweater, the kind that men in their fifties protestingly receive from their smiling wives and children on their birthdays that they don’t remember themselves.</p>

<p><em>slurp slurp slurp</em> he goes, maneuvering his chopsticks to take in the noodles one by one. They are oily, and slide pleasantly off his chopsticks. I’m across from him, waiting for my bowl and writing in this journal, wondering if he notices that I write in English, no way can I write in Chinese anymore, wondering if he picks out the broken Mandarin I offer the waiter (<em>炸酱面 (zha jiang mian)?</em> I offer wiltingly) (it slips out of my mouth and flops onto the floor).</p>

<p>He is methodical, I can see him in the same light in his lecture (Physics? Artificial Intelligence? Geology? Rennaisance Lit?), perhaps pausing thoughtfully after a student’s question (looking up at the flourescent bulbs, absentmindedly twirling the query around his chalk piece as it hovers over the board. So much hesitation: the students wait with bated breath). Then he writes something with bold forceful strokes, saying nothing, but it is profound! I can’t see the board, but it is brilliant and the classroom gasps (but not too loudly, for a Confucian respect of teachers). If you look closely, a wry grin tugs at the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>Five minutes pass, ten, fifteen. He just keeps his eyes down and soon the eggplant on his plate is gone, the soup lays placid, the red chili oil pools on the plate. I reconsider: he looks uncomfortable, maybe even lonely.</p>

<p>He never looks up to acknowledge my presence, but perhaps that’s because that’s the custom here when strangers are seated at the same table. It was bound to happen (I walked in alone this afternoon; there was no way they would give me my own table at this crowded noodle shop).</p>

<p>That would never fly in the good ol’ USA (God bless the USA). We believe in <em>personal space</em>, as in spacious skies and as in amber waves of grain! God bless the USA where we have six-lane main streets and cowboys and hipsters and Wal-Mart™ and Cafe Gratitude (the Berkeley cafe where the cheesecake there is called <em>“Beautiful”</em>, and to order it you have to force yourself to tell the waiter <em>I am… uh… Beautiful</em>). God bless the USA where everything is Occupied and people are angry and proud and scared at the same time. I too am proud of being American, see my Reeboks™ and crisp English and my silent, snobby mental critiques and my Moleskine™ full of English letters, aye be cee dee yee whoops—a flick of a stray noodle stains a page with sesame oil.</p>

<p><em>Slurp slurp slurp</em>, the Senior Gentleman in front of me takes it all in stride, which is to say he never notices me. Does he want to leave? I half hope so, because the foreign, American me is feeling awkward sitting across from this stranger. He rummages in his bag, composed as ever, smacking his lips. Standing, he takes an awfully long time to put on his windbreaker, buttoning from the top to the bottom, <em>pop, pop, pop</em>, shuffling as he walks out to pay the bill.</p>

<p>But no, I decide he carries an air of simplicity, not in a shortsighted or fumbling way, but in a sagely manner that quiets me and piques my interest. The way a <em>laoshi</em> should teach. I let that image float for a bit, then get up to pay my bill.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been running for the past week or so, despite my grandma’s protests (“you’ll catch a cold”). It used to be easier with the jet lag, when I’d get up at 5am and stare at the wall and catch myself wondering <em>where</em> exactly I was.</p>

<p>It’s been generally drizzly here for the past week or so, which is a blessing and a curse. I’ve felt self-conscious since arriving, noticing that nobody here runs, and I wonder if I’m being too aggressive, pushing too fast when I dodge the passersbys. I’ve decided there is no better feeling than running with the rain slipping off your skin, hot breath hovering between your chest and your shirt while dodging cars and scooters and disapproving old ladies. It’s a powerful feeling, and a very <em>living</em> thing to be doing.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Everything’s concrete here, and my knees are feeling it. It’s not like it used to be, when my dad would run barefoot on the <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2008/05/12/in-my-dads-shoes/">banks of the Xindian River</a> in his boyhood hometown. Nowadays the whole deal is paved over with asphalt and tile and basketball courts, a veritable concrete jungle.</p>

<p>“Let’s go see the river” my Dad announces one day. On the day we are to go, preceding events yawn and billow and suddenly we can’t work the visit in.</p>

<p>One morning I decide to visit anyways and head out early, stepping out into brilliant sunlight (it’s been raining the whole week). I’m taking the roads, out behind <em>fuzhoushan</em> park, down <em>keelung</em> road, past treasure hill and on out to the bike paths by the river. It’s exhausting, and an hour later I’m there. The river is muddled, uninspiring; it cuts a wide swath and lies flat and unperturbed (lifeless, I decide). Cars and city noise roar over bridges, expressways. Concrete frames the landscape, creeping into the banks of the river and damming its tributaries.</p>

<p>I try to imagine my dad as a kid again, playing barefoot in glassy waters and catching fish in a carefree <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>-esque existence. Maybe I’m in the wrong place. Maybe he lived in an alternate space, time, and riverbank where the factories and skyscrapers haven’t yet grown and his toes sink into moist earth. Whatever it is, the sun is in my eyes and I want to go home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Annie asked me this morning in the LAX terminal if I was looking forward to doing anything once we arrived in Taipei. I froze because I really hadn&rsquo;t thought about it. The only thing I had thought about was what it would be like to see <em>yie yie</em> (my grandpa on my dad&rsquo;s side), now 90 years old&mdash;the man that shaped my father, who shaped me. This may be our last time together.</p>

<p>I feel different this time around (I was eighteen the last time I visited). Older, but not necessarily in <em>that</em> way. Like I have the wits about me to wrap around people and feel their bumps and bruises. I feel like I can understand him more through the lens of my dad. His faults, and his irrefutable spirit are at play in my dad, and most likely in me. Maybe I&rsquo;m more alert to the forces at play in his life, my father&rsquo;s life and mine: the legacy of the Revolution, his time spent in the KMT military, and my father&rsquo;s childhood spent along the banks of the river.</p>

<p>I want to know the source of <em>yie yie&rsquo;s</em> joy</p>

<p>Show me what a life lived in grace looks like: unfettered, joyous, rampant.</p>

<p>I told someone once that I wanted to have the guts to laugh at myself and loosen up a bit. I think I was born melancholy (and I protested as much when I tested so in a personality test&mdash;this much is true about my artist tendencies&mdash;but I hated the word. It made me sound depressed). Mainly what I saw and disliked in myself were my perfectionistic tendencies, because it&rsquo;s easier to deal with knowns and facts and details and my capabilities than to face the chaos of messy-and-human.</p>

<p>Show me how to hold onto life loosely.</p>

<p>Perhaps what C.S. Lewis says is true, that having a grasp of our mortality does us a lot of good. I want to understand that our good moments don&rsquo;t last forever, and that to savor them slowly is a gift in itself. And maybe the guts I wanted are the insides that I want filled with thick, hearty gratitude, shared and spilled over in the company of friends (I&rsquo;m using soup imagery because Eric made a frickin good stew the other night. And it&rsquo;s cold in here.).</p>

<p>Hearty, joyous, wise and gracious. I think that describes the man I&rsquo;d like to grow into.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/6325341766/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6235/6325341766_6102cb11da.jpg" alt="Occupy Oakland" /></a></p>

<p>There was some sort of relief, I decided, in having set foot in the Occupy camp and finding it quiet. Wednesday, Oakland was paraded across the global consciousness as national news media displayed scenes of urban warfare, with ghostly images of terror-stricken faces sent helter-skelter across the airwaves. Zach showed me the frontpage of the BBC website (<em>Occupy Oakland protestors disrupt city</em>) and made a cutting remark about how the protestors were making fools of themselves on global media and how Oakland was going to suffer. The next morning we all got worried emails and well-intentioned text messages from friends and family: <em>hey, you doing okay? </em>to which we&rsquo;d respond with sheepish grace that no, we weren&rsquo;t part of the protests and no, Oakland hadn&rsquo;t burnt to the ground. Yet.</p>

<p>That Saturday we walked the downtown Oakland area and stood among the protestors in Frank Ogawa Plaza and I tried taking it in, inhaling the hot, musty mess, sidling up to the sleeping giant. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I had expected: chaos, rowdier citizens, widespread aggression and disquiet? Instead we found sleepy-eyed campers, dreadlocked ponytails, and hand-drawn raggedy signs. You could smell the weed from blocks away. Nate confirmed the portable toilets were overflowing and rancid.</p>

<p>Self-conscious, I realized later, is how I feel, not knowing how to identify with this spectacle. My sentiments about the whole thing are less of explosive outrage than subtle helplessness. Here I was, middle-class and Asian-American, walking through the tent city of the dispossessed, and I felt both a repulsion to the sideshow and an isolating sense of guilt knowing that I was a stranger to racial and economic injustice.</p>

<p>We bumped into Bonnie on the way over, a homeless friend of ours who makes appearances often at the church. &#8221;You should have been there, they had us <em>cornered</em>&ldquo; she exclaimed with wide eyes, giggling in her two-toned accent. <em>&rdquo;</em>Pohh-leece got us trapped up on both sides. I got some of that gas stuff in me, and it make you tear up real bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonnie had stayed with the protestors for a couple of days. &ldquo;It was like a <em>war</em>, let me tell you, and the sad thing&rdquo;&mdash;her voice dropped to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;is nobody can help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wondered what Bonnie must have felt; my mind replayed scenes from a Free Speech Movement documentary I once watched at Cal. Observe: an aerial shot from what must have been a tall building or a helicopter, riot police on either ends of the block, smoke rising from the street in lazy, elegant arcs. Notice: a couple of figures limp for cover, fumbling to cover their eyes. See: grainy film, shot black and white, <em>viva</em> free speech &amp; the cause of justice, <em>fin</em>.</p>

<p>So I was relieved to find Frank Ogawa Plaza rather pleasant. A tent city had risen, built on fresh-laid straw, with hypnotic Native American drumming drifting through camp. Smiling stoners sat cross-legged in a corner beneath a tarp and gazed intently into the distance. A mini-rally proceeded in another, where a megaphone-toting Latina woman was organizing that afternoon&rsquo;s march on Wells Fargo<em>. </em>In other words, it was amusingly like college. We opened our burritos and ate on the steps of the City Hall amphitheater and watched the tent city pulse as it awoke.</p>

<p>The Tuesday night that things got bad, I was running the lake under the assured hum of news helicopters, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell you if things were out of the ordinary. It was strange, I suppose because I had imagined that should my city go down in flames, everybody should know about it and share in the panic and outrage. Women pushed murmuring babies by in fancy strollers. The wind whispered through the grove of trees around the lake&rsquo;s finger-bend. Runners grunted to each other, pushing gravel through the ground. Starlight &amp; Lake Merritt&rsquo;s necklace, swan, geese, &amp; ghetto birds all there to witness war, but somebody had forgotten to remind me.</p>

<p>Saturday, Kylan and Betty and I walked up Telegraph and prayed for Occupy Oakland and I felt rather foolish for not knowing what exactly to pray for. I remembered Silvia&rsquo;s weight of sadness, when she showed up and wound up feeling lost and helpless and hurt for the brokenness of the world she lived in and the chaos unfolding around her and the need for Jesus to show up right there and <em>occupy</em>&hellip;</p>

<p>Proverbs 29 was a comfort, the words breathing and expanding in my thoughts:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>When the righteous increase, the people rejoice but when the wicked rule, people groan</em></p></blockquote>

<p>and,</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The poor and the oppressor meet together, the LORD gives light to them both</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/6325344666/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6040/6325344666_68f59b38d3.jpg" alt="Occupy Oakland" /></a></p>

<p>Earlier that morning I dreamt we were evacuating our city in long single-file strands. We wound through our neighborhood, and I remember standing in our living room arguing with Justin whether we should load this or that couch into the U-Haul. People shuffled by outside in colorless clothing, feeling here and gone at the same time. Children whispered to each other in shy, hushed tones. The helicopters were there again, whirling lazily, watching overhead. In that moment I knew (though a dream) the question had become not how we would leave, but whether we would stay.</p>

<p>I woke far too early, thirsty, trying to recall how the air felt against my cheeks: <em>thwup thwup thwup thwup thwup.</em></p>

<p>I smelled it coming last week, but it didn&rsquo;t arrive until today. It smelled like autumn, it was warm rain, ticklish; it was musty with diamond dew and faded memories of running through these trees at our old church camp site, redwood trees tickling the clouds and the sweet fragrance of pine cones and the pricks of needles in my shoes. That&rsquo;s the kind of place where the mist envelops your eyes and causes you to blink, over and over and over again. Memories of the bell ringing on the steeple, calling us in for dinner as we would push past adults with understanding smiles to get to turkey and gravy and pumpkin pie, stuffing ourselves and running back out into the wild, pretending we were secret agents.</p>

<p>But there it was again in a different form, carrying us back from LA through the fertile fields of the Central Valley, sunlight streaking over our heads and we drove back and debated whether we were old or not. That previous night at the wedding I asked my table if they&rsquo;d ever really felt <em>old</em>, and that maybe the better question was whether we ever wished we were <em>young</em> again. We all laughed it off, or at least a bit nervously. I wonder if there&rsquo;s a slight terror to the feeling of it overcoming us, afraid that maybe one day we&rsquo;d wake up and feel some gloom of extra gravity and it&rsquo;d hit us: <em>oh crap </em>and we&rsquo;d carry this fear to our twenty-fifth year high school reunions, strung &lsquo;round our necks like medallions. But there rushing past sunkissed fields listening to country crooners I wondered if I&rsquo;d ever really grow old, with the sun on my back and laughter, sweet laughter around me.</p>

<p>I think the warmth of autumn reminds me that all things must change, they must grow and move in season. One day I know I must be old, and I will have known a love that is young and weathered, resilient and yielding and tested True. I will have known the courage of a little boy, spoken to the weighty fears of my young man self, into the maturity that awaits on the other side, the line that we will not know we have crossed until the leaves have long since changed their color.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I woke on the wrong side of the bed, knowing full well I couldn&rsquo;t go back to sleep in this heat. I was annoyed that it was already 7:15 and it was already too late to get to prayer, too early to go to the office, too late to go for a run and too late to go back to bed. So I hung around in a daze of sleep debt and wondered why it couldn&rsquo;t be 10 degrees cooler, why I felt so <em>tired</em>. I tried to read scripture but just got annoyed at how good it was, how soggy my cereal was, and how I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate and how far I felt from Jesus. I got mad at how guilty I&rsquo;ve been feeling about it all&mdash;about <em>what</em> exactly?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. My jaw is sore; I&rsquo;ve been grinding my teeth in my sleep lately. It&rsquo;s my wake-up call to the fact that I&rsquo;m generally really stressed, but never really aware of it.</p>
