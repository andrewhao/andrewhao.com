  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some random things I&rsquo;ve been working on:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been knocking off all the little emails, uploads, todo&rsquo;s and errands that have been sitting on the back burner for months. Let me tell you that it is a GOOD feeling watching them disappear off that to-do list.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.wejoinin.com">Wejoinin&rsquo;s got a blog</a>! We&rsquo;ll keep you updated on how things are progressing. I&rsquo;ve been doing iterative design with some UI mockups and working on some site templates. Hsiu-fan&rsquo;s working at Google this summer so he&rsquo;ll be up to his ears in work, but he&rsquo;ll find some time once in awhile to to chip in with some sweet code.</li>
<li>I built a <a href="http://www.usbwifi.orcon.net.nz/">poor man&rsquo;s WiFi antenna</a> with a USB WiFi adapter and a strainer (please welcome the term, &ldquo;wok-fi&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s taking up a good chunk of my desk but it&rsquo;s working pretty well :D</li>
<li>I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-Nikkor-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-2461799-0554231?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1182210679&amp;sr=8-1">50mm fixed f/1.8 lens</a> for the Nikon and shucks, it&rsquo;s amazing. I&rsquo;m looking for an opportunity to shoot with this guy.</li>
<li>My jump shot. Ah, not much to say there :(</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Four years have passed and today I sit down at our old Yamaha upright and open up Khachaturian&rsquo;s Tocatta. It is one of the few pieces I recall playing.</p>

<p>My fingers recall their positions quicker than I expect, and I remember banging away at Tocatta, a fast, furious and highly technical piece sophomore year in high school. I loved playing it because it was complex and fast. It was loud, then it was deadly quiet.</p>

<p>I used to play this piece furiously and more physically than I had to as a way to take out my frustration at the keys and retaliate at Natalia. Ironically, she loved the performance.</p>

<p>Tocatta is not a piece for listening. You can only enjoy it by playing it. On some sections my fingers moved so fast I felt I was flying, then I would sink back into swirling polyrhythms and 10-tuplets. I loved the pure physicality of the piece.</p>

<p>So this afternoon I haltingly play it again, balking at the sheer technicality of it all. Time relaxes my fingers, and I gather the nerve to play each section quicker and quicker (but never too fast lest I taste bittersweet memories).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I switched piano teachers in the sixth grade. My first teacher was a kindly, aging American man by the name of John. My earliest memories of piano lessons were of me sitting in an antique chair his dim, musky studio. I&rsquo;d pretend I was sleeping so I could skim a couple of minutes off my lesson, always to be awakened by a couple of his cats brushing by. I suspect they consulted with some other Chinese parents and came to the conclusion that John didn&rsquo;t push me hard enough. That&rsquo;s when they switched me to Natalia&rsquo;s studio.</p>

<p>Her name was Natalia, but my mother somehow confused it with Natasha. I remember my mother got it wrong on the first day, when she greeted Natalia with a handshake and I peered over at a few of her recital handouts on the piano bench and noticed the correct spelling. This sort of awkward greeting continued over the next five years, but I never did bother correcting my mom.</p>

<p>Natalia was Russian, and we students all knew what that meant&mdash;intensity. Russian piano teachers rank at the top of the intensity scale, followed only by Chinese piano teachers (but not by much). Yes, that is a tongue-in-cheek statement.</p>

<p>But yes, Natalia was intense (and I&rsquo;m pretty sure any number of us could testify about our own piano instructors). I don&rsquo;t know how to describe this facial expression of hers&mdash;a cross between concern and intense concentration, perpetually across her face. I think I can count on my fingers the number of times I ever saw her smile.</p>

<p>Okay, so I never practiced. I couldn&rsquo;t! After all I had tons of other stuff to do. Practice was boring. And I always played well enough&hellip;</p>

<p>Well enough for me, I suppose. I think every one of those lessons, I got the Glare and/or a lot of nagging and yelling. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you practiced?&rdquo; &ldquo;This part sounds terrible&rdquo; &ldquo;Play this section like I told you to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now all of these statements were true (and well-deserved). But in my mind, I had made up my mind that Natalia was against me. After all, Natalia&rsquo;s roster of students included many to-be prodigies. Actually I think every one of her students was an outstanding pianist who always topped their level in the CM examinations and put beaming smiles on their parents&#8217; faces.</p>

<p>I always walked in thinking I was going to disappoint her. And for pretty much every weekly lesson those five years, I walked out feeling frustrated and worthless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;A church needs legs and wings,&rdquo; says my friend Dan. &ldquo;Legs to keep us firmly grounded in terra firma, wings to experience the Divine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a year of developing legs. I spent much of the beginning of this year asking hard questions and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/565211780/on-me-pour-out.html">examining the foundations</a> of my faith. I&rsquo;ve been catching up on theology and really digging deeper into the Word, getting a fuller intellectual grasp on my faith. Dang, it&rsquo;s been amazing.</p>

<p>But I think I&rsquo;m ready to grow some wings. Faith as a somewhat academic exercise is rather hollow. Part of what I&rsquo;ve lost in these latter years is a sense of wonder, a child-like trust and my big dreams in a big God.</p>

<p>Joy! That&rsquo;s what I miss. Simple, delirious joy being with Dad.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m pressing into this summer. Knowing the Father. Meditating on the beauty of the Gospel. Just kicking it with Dad. I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s so simple.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; I tell a friend, &ldquo;the longer we&rsquo;re here, the less we seem to care about grades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flashback, 4 years: It&rsquo;s senior year and I&rsquo;m pulling an all-nighter a week for sixth-period AP Biology. Why? I don&rsquo;t think I could have told you either.</p>

<p>This year: I sleep. Even if I have a 10-pager and a oral tech pitch due the next day, I&rsquo;m gonna get my sleep.</p>

<p>A part of it is avoidance: I just don&rsquo;t tend to think very much about a letter grade. If there&rsquo;s one thing that my Dad&rsquo;s drilled into my head, it&rsquo;s the fact that &ldquo;all you can do is your best&rdquo;. So at the end of everything, I ask myself if my work was reflective of my best effort within my boundaries of well-being. If I can answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that, I am satisfied.</p>

<p>Another part of it is understanding the Big Picture. I think I&rsquo;m going to choose to trust in God&rsquo;s control of the world rather than be driven by fear&mdash;of being lesser than my peers, of not making it into grad school, of not getting that sweet internship.</p>

<p>One last thing: guys, we&rsquo;re freakin&#8217; blessed to be studying here. What an amazing opportunity, being at the best public uni in the world (ok, give me a little slack with that statement). 99.99% of the world will never get anything close to what we have. (Aside: what are we going to do with this gift? I pray we don&rsquo;t keep it to ourselves.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been rather freeing, moving out of this paradigm of striving and academic bondage and into gratitude and security.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Junior year has brought on a whole new wave of responsibilities and realizations that you&rsquo;re only getting older. Here are a few of my own:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Realizing that I&rsquo;m a few years off of the working world.</p></li>
<li><p> Witnessing the beginnings of a soul patch. Boo. Yeah. Hipsterhood, here I come.</p></li>
<li> Holding a decent conversation about politics.</li>
<li> Holding a decent conversation about politics at a cocktail party.</li>
<li> Holding a decent conversation about politics at a cocktail party and wishing the hosts would bring out Teddy Grahams over the hors de&#8217;oeuvres.</li>
<li> Cleaning my apartment toilet without flinching.</li>
<li> Budgeting.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/525491277/geek-brief.html">GTD-ing my email inbox</a>.</li>
<li> Discipling the tightest bunch of bros.</li>
<li>. Having a conversation about the inner workings of the once-mythical GameShark, mythical no more (innocence stripped by CS classes).</li>
<li>. Knowing friends who are starting companies and more friends who are <a href="http://www.gumballcapital.org/">doing good in the world</a>.</li>
<li>. Building solid relationships in my small group with married folks, working folks, family folks.</li>
<li>. Getting excited about Web development and how it might play into my work in the near future.</li>
<li><p>. Working on <a href="http://www.wejoinin.com">WeJoinIn</a> with <a href="http://hsiufan.eats.porkbuns.net">Hsiu-Fan</a> and thinking about how to take this baby out of the nest and onto the Web.</p></li>
<li><p>. We started high school seven years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>. Being challenged to dream ten years into the future.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Here&rsquo;s a question:</h3>

<p>Were you ever one of those kids who knew exactly what you wanted to be when you grew up? (It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you actually followed through!) Where are you now, and are you happy with it?</p>
