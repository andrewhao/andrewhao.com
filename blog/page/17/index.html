  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like observing kindness demonstrated by strangers to other strangers.</p>

<p>Today at lunch, a couple walked by my table and let me know that I had dropped my wallet. Turns out it had fallen out of my pocket onto the ground. Small gesture, but it meant a lot to me.</p>

<p>I also like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Seeing students talking to homeless people, treating them with dignity.</p></li>
<li><p> Good sportsmanship: guys calling fouls on themselves in pickup games.</p></li>
<li><p> Strangers giving blind folks an arm to lead them in the right direction.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This semester&rsquo;s been one of changes. Among them is my decision to bring my bike up to school and do some good ol-fashioned pedaling around Berkeley.</p>

<p>I brought the bike I used to ride in the seventh grade&mdash;complete with the bike rack on the bike I used to strap my clarinet into. Yeah, it&rsquo;s that old. The chains are squeaky and the derailleurs are unreliable at best and my brakes are on the verge of not working&hellip; but trust me when I say my bike&rsquo;s ridable :)</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m not really trying to save the air, I&rsquo;m more trying to save on gas and parking costs. And it&rsquo;s always nice getting a workout going wherever I need to go.</p>

<p>A couple of observations from personal experience ever since making the jump:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s a hipster secret: you really do get cooler when you roll up your right pant leg. Too bad it&rsquo;s so much trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>Riding a bike in auto traffic is a terrifying experience. On your left is certain death from cars wanting to run you over. On your right are rows of cars whose drivers-side door threaten to open into your face at any moment. I will never get frustrated at another slow biker on the road again.</p></li>
<li><p>I love the feeling of high momentum, newly-poured smooth asphalt and an open road.</p></li>
<li><p>The campus no-bike zones have really, really changed my commute patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>I still have to get that bike license from the UCPD.</p></li>
<li><p>Mountain bikes are a GOOD deal heavier than those spiffy road bikes. I&rsquo;ve had a ton of grief carrying my bike up and down the BART stairwells.</p></li>
<li><p>I can make a solid grocery store run and carry back everything I need so long as I a) strap on a milk crate to my bike rack with LOTS of bungee cords and b) bring my backpack to carry some excess food.</p></li>
<li><p>In the previous event, the bike will become very rear-heavy. Watch how you throw your weight around on the bike&mdash;one bad angle at the wrong speed and you will definitely have spilt groceries.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people can look cool on a bike. I just look dorky.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of traffic. Especially not the Friday afternoon get-me-outta-LA kind of traffic.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I nearly rear-ended another car as it abruptly braked. I don&rsquo;t remember slamming on the brakes as hard as i did then, and my car gave everybody the show of making terrible skidding noises and leaving a trail of tire smoke, NASCAR style. Afterwards I cupped my head in my hands and let my heart slow down from a million miles an hour.</p>

<p>On a somewhat related note, I also woke up an hour earlier to start the commute from the Bay Area so I could drive slower and 1) avoid speed traps and 2) try to set a mileage record. I averaged probably a little under 65MPH on Highway 5&mdash;that&rsquo;s an excruciatingly slow pace, just ask everybody behind me&mdash;took about an hour longer to get there than I would have, and drove an incredible 31.8 MPG (up till LA traffic, of course). Not bad for an Accord rated to go 23 MPG highway (that&rsquo;s a 25% increase in fuel economy)!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been good times with the family. I&rsquo;m here in SD to see Annie and Esther off to school (both are attending UCSD now) and have a long day at IKEA and with the tool set ahead of me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I’m writing this series to chronicle</em> <em>my forays into cooking. For myself. Let’s say that on the cooking scale of 1 to 10, one being a rock and ten being Rachael Ray, I’m a zero. Get ready for a wacky and wild ride into Andrew’s gastronomical world…</em></p>

<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s morning. I&rsquo;ve just come back from a run. I&rsquo;m <em>huuuuungry</em>. Let me give you a glimpse into my morning meal, beginning with the cereal:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Open up nearly-empty milk carton. Pour into bowl.</p></li>
<li><p> Shake in some cereal.</p></li>
<li><p> Eat.</p></li>
<li><p> Dang. Milk ran out before the cereal.</p></li>
<li><p> Pour in milk from pretty-much-empty milk carton.</p></li>
<li><p> Eat.</p></li>
<li><p> Dang. Cereal ran out before the milk.</p></li>
<li><p> Shake in some more cereal.</p></li>
<li><p> Eat.</p></li>
<li><p>. Milk ran out before cereal.</p></li>
<li><p>. Rejected! There is no more milk from now-empty milk carton. Miserably chomp through the rest of cereal.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Onto the fruit portion of our competition:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Eat like six plums. Why plums? You thought they were the best fruit-per-ounce value at Trader Joe&rsquo;s.</p></li>
<li><p> You don&rsquo;t like plums very much.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Finishing off with toast:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Still hungry. Let&rsquo;s try toast.</p></li>
<li><p> Pull out week-old bread from plastic bag.</p></li>
<li><p> Cut out as many moldy parts as you can find. Pray you found them all.</p></li>
<li><p> Throw em into toaster. The heat should neutralize the mold, right?</p></li>
<li><p> Spread jam with dirty knife in the dish rack.</p></li>
<li><p> Eat. Remind yourself to thank the wonderful souls who invented toast.</p></li>
<li><p> Clean up the dang mess you made in the toaster and all over your table.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I want cereal again. But there is no more milk.</p>

<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ve got leftover pasta sauce from yesterday&rsquo;s spaghetti. I&rsquo;ve got two slices of bread. And I&rsquo;ve got some salad.</p>

<p><strong>How to live:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p> Toast bread</p></li>
<li><p> Pour pasta sauce carefully over a slice of bread</p></li>
<li><p> Wipe up the dang mess you made with the pasta sauce</p></li>
<li><p> Top with the greens</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I oftentimes talk about how maturity is a hard process. These past few months have been times of self-discovery. A peek into the rough-and-tumble, <em>totally</em> awkward journey of self-awareness&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>I have an EQ of a doorknob. </strong>I used to think I was pretty sensitive and in touch with how I felt&mdash;how mistaken I was. A few months into my relationship with Sarah, I basically realized that I am an emotional Neanderthal. I don&rsquo;t have a very large vocabulary to describe my feelings and I realize that I am <em>totally</em> clueless as to the reasons why I feel things (Psychologists will tell us that <em>nobody</em> knows why they truly feel things, but still. I take this to whole new levels.)</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>I have time-delayed emotions.</strong> After some big event or disagreement, I won&rsquo;t know how I feel about things until about a day afterwards. This is a huge contrast to Sarah, who feels things on the spot. I&rsquo;m trying to understand why, but I think it&rsquo;s partially because of my (aforementioned) stunted emotional development. It also makes things hard for us as we resolve issues and disagreements because I can&rsquo;t quite fully bring my side to the table at the moment.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>I process things best by writing. </strong>Seeing words on a page or computer screen legitimize them for me. If I go too long without journaling or blogging, I start feeling lost and disoriented (or just really uneasy). It&rsquo;s like feeling like I have this big backlog of things to write down, but they don&rsquo;t enter reality until they&rsquo;re written. Which is most likely why I&rsquo;m writing this post.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>I value other&rsquo;s approval of myself, often to an unhealthy degree</strong>. There&rsquo;s this people-pleaser in me (that I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://blog.andrewhao.com/2007/09/29/there-is-a-perfectionist-in-me-that-i-cant-quite-get-rid-of-so-i-took-a-shady-internet-survey/">previously written about</a>) that I&rsquo;m trying to shake. Much of my identity is founded in how I&rsquo;m perceived by others. As such, I&rsquo;m often a social chameleon, taking on the whims or likes or habits of the people around me. Oftentimes this means I&rsquo;ll be ingratiating with the people I try to please or impress. Nobody wants an imposter as a friend. I&rsquo;d do better being myself&mdash;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:1;&amp;version=47;">the lil kid with a proud Dad</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>I&rsquo;m starting to find and use my voice</strong>. I grew up with subtle cultural values that taught me to adhere to the norm, suppress my opinions and to do things that pleased others. Which are actually really, really good in certain contexts, but often lead to unhealthy, unbalanced relationships. I realized recently that I am still really shy about speaking up and saying how I feel if it inconveniences (麻煩) others. I am learning to become comfortable speaking up, speaking truth into others&#8217; lives and voicing my needs.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>I&rsquo;m a workaholic because I put my worth in what I can produce. </strong>I&rsquo;m definitely a by-the-book Type-A personality. Which is cool, because I can get lots of stuff done. Which is cool, because I&rsquo;m fairly confident in my abilities. Which is not cool, because I begin to sacrifice more important things (friends, relationships, family) for the sake of &ldquo;finishing this project&rdquo; or &ldquo;beating the deadline&rdquo;. On one hand I know that I have God-given talents and abilities and doing quality work is Good. On the other hand, I can&rsquo;t let it get out of control and consume me and become one more idol to chase.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>I&rsquo;m still figuring out friendships</strong>. This one is pretty hard to write about. I&rsquo;m not very good at keeping in touch with people. Maybe this is because I always exude an air of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really busy right now,&rdquo; which is alienating. I should think that it&rsquo;s more of a matter of time, though. I think it might be a matter of valuing them for who they are. Maybe it&rsquo;s because my old buddies and I seem to be in very different places now. I don&rsquo;t know. But I do fear losing the genuine friends I&rsquo;ve gotten to know over the years, whether by distance or inevitable circumstance or otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>I really value my family</strong>. Being at home this summer makes me realize how much I missed them. And it made me realize even more how much I took them for granted from high school through college. There are some big changes in store for us: Esther&rsquo;s moving in soon at UCSD and my mom and dad are headed off to China for a period of time. I just know that I love em.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With a City like this, calamities are bound to happen. A elderly man slips down a narrow stairwell and dislocates his hip. Sirens interrupt throngs of hungry shoppers as two ladder trucks rush down the Market. A red-headed biker caroms off a distracted SUV, and snaps his collarbone. Blaring phones put 911 operators on edge. A toddler stops to admire the red-metal monsters. Around the corner, a girl sizes up a pencil skirt through a store window.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Hungry eyes follow you over concrete bridges. To look away from them is to acknowledge their power over you. To gaze back into them is to compel you into backbreaking compassion. Apathy, it seems, tries to do both and none at all.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before we begin, let me say THANK YOU to all of you who&rsquo;ve contributed to the International Justice Mission cause! In the span of just two weeks, <strong>we&rsquo;ve raised over $800</strong>!<strong> </strong>Thank you for your generosity! It&rsquo;s our hope that we wouldn&rsquo;t just give and turn away, but our hearts would be more sensitized as our giving solidifies the link between our wallets and our hearts.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Another big THANK YOU to all of you who had been instrumental in encouraging me to press on in my training for this event. This event was like no other I&rsquo;ve ever been to.</p>

<p>It struck me on race day what a fraternal sport running is; everybody&rsquo;s in it together. So when we all gathered up at the starting line, strangers were giving each other pep talks, finishers walked back on the course to encourage stragglers, and a good bunch of three runners stopped running completely to come to my aid after I graciously faceplanted with a cramped calf.</p>

<p>So the weeks before, I&rsquo;d been sidelined a bit with a knee injury (tendonitis in my left knee). Therefore, I&rsquo;d been running only gym workouts for a good two weeks before race day. No long, extended distances, which led me to doubt my readiness on race day.</p>

<p>Typical marathon workouts encourage you to run four or five 20+ mile workouts in your training routine prior to racing. I had been averaging 13-14mi on my long runs in the months prior, so I was about six miles short of being a truly prepared runner.</p>

<p>Still&mdash;when the starting gun blew, I found myself in this huge sea of people. It was pretty amazing, this sheer number of crazies like me getting out there to run on a chilly morning. I also noticed some stomach pain; perhaps from the weird PowerBar formula I took an hour before.</p>

<p>The Golden Gate was WAY windier than I&rsquo;d expected, not doing much for my stomach. I ended up pacing behind guys with big muscles. I don&rsquo;t know why I did; maybe I just assumed they knew what they were doing. I took the first half pretty easy: I ran a 2:03 split (a 9:25/mi pace).</p>

<p>I started to get a bit more into race mentality on the second half. I got it into my mind to break 4 hours, so I knew I had to catch the 2:00 pacer girl (these are runners who guarantee a certain running pace). So the second half was very much a race to catch up to and pass as many people as possible.</p>

<p><strong>People I remember remembering:</strong> Big Guy with Big Muscles in a Cutoff Shirt, 2:00 Pacer Girl, Girl in Blue Shirt Who I Couldn&rsquo;t Pass The Last Six Miles, and Tony the Popular Guy in a Purple Shirt (everybody he passed was like &ldquo;Go, Tony!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey, Tony!&rdquo; to which he&rsquo;d throw up a peace sign and a million-watt grin).</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect was how hard The Wall would hit me at the 19 mile mark. We were exiting Golden Gate Park when my body told me, &ldquo;Andrew, I think I&rsquo;m done running&rdquo; and started Cramping Mode, which I hadn&rsquo;t really counted on.
The next seven miles were the Longest hour of my life, and it was essentially a lot of awkward running sprinkled with some intermittent cramps in my foot, my calf and my hamstring. They&rsquo;d usually take turns, just to keep it interesting. My mind didn&rsquo;t quite appreciate it. Spectators just laughted.</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is why I didn&rsquo;t get it in my mind to stop and take the time to stretch. I guess I was too doggone set on beating 4 hours, so I&rsquo;d be running through cramps (my body&rsquo;s <em>obvious </em>way of signaling me to stop). It helped that 2:00 Pacer Girl was in striking distance, keeping me on pace for better or worse.</p>

<p>So it completely befuddles me that despite these cramps and a fall that I&rsquo;d run my second half faster than the first: 1:58 (at a respectable 9:13/mi pace). What in the world happened there? No idea.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s just say that one of the greatest feelings in the world (well.. it&rsquo;s pretty up there) is crossing that finish line and just feeling your body scream for joy of Being Done. And is that food on those tables over there? Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be over there.</p>

<p>Major props to Tony for finishing his half marathon in style and being a great help in IJM fundraising. Of course, Sarah was as patient and amazing as ever in trucking our weary bodies all around SF that morning and afternoon.</p>

<p>All in all, a wonderful feeling, this marathon thing. Really, I&rsquo;m not crazy. I just like the feeling of moving forward, the inexorable draw toward the finish line and the charge to persevere.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s talk of running more races in the fall. Anybody interested?</p>

<h3>A Smorgasbord of Pain!</h3>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a feeling: crossing the finish line at 26.2 under the Bay Bridge in incredible agony, a massive sense of relief and food, glorious food waiting for you on the other side.</p>

<p>What a feeling: running in a huge sea of people, making conversation with strangers, wondering what their stories are.</p>

<p>What a feeling: crossing the Golden Gate bridge at 7 in the morning, the wind blowing you about and the North Bay illuminated by shafts of light running through the clouds. The eucalyptus trees frame the coast perfectly and insulate you from the seaside gusts.</p>

<p>What a feeling: high-fiving strangers, gulping down energy drinks and carb gel at random intervals. A random Trojan warrior shows up here and there running in full armor.</p>

<p>What a feeling: running through cramps over the last 8 miles, your face contorted in every possible way (and <a href="http://www.marathonfoto.com/index.cfm?RaceOID=27892008M1&amp;LastName=HAO&amp;BibNumber=7586&amp;Mailing=16254">ruining all of your photographs</a>), your mind turned to mush and all higher-level mind faculties shut down, leaving you to just run and breathe and ignore the pain.</p>

<p>What a feeling: cramping up and faceplanting a mile from the finish and having three guys come to your help. One of them offers you salt tablets, his energy drink and runs with you a short distance making sure you&rsquo;re all right.</p>

<p>What a feeling: feeding off the energy of thousands, people running with various disabilities, running for causes. You bump into a few other runners with IJM t-shirts and you swap stories.</p>

<p>What a feeling: tears forming in your eyes; you wonder if it&rsquo;s because of the pain or if you&rsquo;re just really that emotional.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>To be continued&mdash;more thoughts and photos to come!</p>
