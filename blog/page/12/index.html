  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am learning that there is a responsibility to being known by another. Sarah and I can&rsquo;t expect to read each other perfectly right off the bat. Nor can we coast off the years we&rsquo;ve been together.</p>

<p>I am only starting to learn about myself. Really. There is work to be done that I&rsquo;ve simply ignored for years. And it&rsquo;s kind of exciting! What motivates me? What makes me mad and why? Why am I the person I am? It&rsquo;s so freaking easy to do the daily routine thing: go to work and come back, fill your life with activities and people and events and commuting that you don&rsquo;t have time to stop and think and just listen.</p>

<p>They say communication is a two-way street, and I&rsquo;m only figuring out that there is much more to plumb from the depths. And it&rsquo;s good for the two of us. If I can explain myself and my feelings and motivations better, then Sarah has more than assumptions to go off on.</p>

<p>And at the same time I realize that this journey of self-realization can be twisted into an exercise in navel-gazing. May I know myself not to make myself more than I really am (a twisted shell of the Original design), but to communicate with ever-more honesty.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started to take breaks more often in the afternoons. I&rsquo;ll walk down Howard and up 1st to a little courtyard that I&rsquo;ve found and just journal and think and watch traffic pass on by.</p>

<p>These days with the weather getting warmer, a walk out in the city is just what I need to recenter and relax. And get some good time in with Jesus too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One point of friction between myself and Sarah is that we have a really, really hard time communicating. I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t help that women are elaborate enigmas, and as men we are Astonishingly Dense. Gentlemen, tell me if you&rsquo;ve ever heard the following from your ladies:</p>

<p><em>You just don&rsquo;t get me.</em></p>

<p><em>I wanted you to listen and feel with me.</em></p>

<p><em>Stop giving me solutions and just listen to me.</em></p>

<p><em>Why are you so quiet?</em></p>

<p><em>No, that&rsquo;s not what I meant.</em></p>

<p><em>Are you listening to me?</em></p>

<p><em>I want you to want to.</em></p>

<p><em>I don&rsquo;t have to tell you; you should just know it already.</em></p>

<p><strong>WELL,</strong></p>

<p>Sarah just gave me the Best Valentine&rsquo;s Gift Ever:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1098&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically like getting the other team&rsquo;s playbook. Everybody wins, so it&rsquo;s even better.&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC0378.jpg"><img src="http://www.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC0378-500x332.jpg" alt="" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Sarah made me an instruction manual for Valentine&rsquo;s Day. No, seriously. It&rsquo;s a cute handcrafted book with little snippets of lists of her likes and dislikes, her basic info, and most of all, this mental model and decision diagram of the female brain (well, hers at least).</p>

<p>My logical, rational, Engineer mind rejoices. I love this girl.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the midst of the craziness of I&rsquo;m realizing that I need better boundaries. Do I really want to be that dad that doesn&rsquo;t know his kids because he&rsquo;s pulling late hours at the office?</p>

<p>At the same time, it&rsquo;s kind of fun staying late with coworkers, sharing in the pain! Ah, yes, it&rsquo;s every single EECS class I ever had, all over again. Fun, but only for the first couple of evenings.</p>

<p>I have to remember I&rsquo;m human and limited. God&rsquo;s sovereign and the work is going to get done with or without me. And God forbid if I am ever controlled by work or stress or deadlines. It&rsquo;s just not worth it. Shake it off. Take a deep breath, Andrew. It&rsquo;s gonna be okay.</p>

<p>This week at Urbana was what I needed. I think I heard what I needed to hear: echoes of the Kingdom told through businesspeople who understand that with regards to their businesses, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not about the money, but all about relationships.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s about being conscientious to how you can use business to advance the Kingdom and change lives: creating jobs, being ethical, opening doors.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been needing some sort of spiritual kick in the pants, and I think I finally feel that there&rsquo;s a door opening with regards to my future. Coming here and getting excited about using my skills and passion about software, design, programming, people&hellip; man. I think this is helping me focus where I need to be going and growing. Mentorship, discipleship, practical real-world business skills, prayer&hellip;</p>

<p>Tom Hsieh is an Asian-American tech entrepreneur whose story tells that story well. Years ago Tom went to Urbana and came away with two convictions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> God&rsquo;s heart was for the urban poor.</p></li>
<li><p> Tom did not love the poor.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Something needed to happen, so Tom decided to move into the inner city after graduation, turning down several lucrative offers and serving with a local church there. He took a part-time computer tech job with flexible hours so he could do his service there.</p>

<p>Tom was successful in what he did and his career advanced. Soon he found himself an executive at Earthlink (in its nascent startup days), where he told us stories about simply being obedient to Jesus in the workplace, living a simple life in the grind of corporate America, living a life of radical giving. Tom and his wife have committed to live at or below the median income level, so that means they give away about 80% of their income. Crazy.</p>

<p>Tom was closing a business deal over a power lunch one day: &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t real!&rdquo; he thought to himself while bringing the slice steak up to his mouth. Hanging out with the neighborhood kids and seeing their smiles? That&rsquo;s real. Being spiritually authentic and Hopeful in a world that denies it? That&rsquo;s real.  Choosing to fight greed with generosity? That&rsquo;s real.</p>

<p>Hearing stories like these this week was good for my soul. More specifically, I think I have some sort of calling to live a focused, missional life. Here. Or overseas. Who knows, and where a few years ago that was something I felt I had to fight, this time around it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s freeing.</p>

<p>Who knows, who knows. It&rsquo;s the start of a new year. New possibilities. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got my bags packed and waiting in an airport in Kansas City en route to <a href="http://urbana09.org">Urbana</a>.</p>

<p>I was thinking today about how much I&rsquo;m seeking a calling (or a life direction, you could say). Life in the working world has its way of sucking you onto its treadmill, where it&rsquo;s easy to simply wake up one day, and a year has passed, and you&rsquo;re still sporting the same haircut.</p>

<p>But I was thinking today that really, this is less about direction than it is about identity. I&rsquo;m known less by my professional aspirations, my friendships, the person I was in college, my performance as a worker in the marketplace than I am simply God&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>I need some sort of kick start, something to make that realization hit home.</p>
