  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I sunk about 50 hours (14 of them were yesterday) into the fourth and final part of this operating system project (~150 hours total) and I must say, I may cry when this baby takes its first steps. Oh wait, there&rsquo;s a tear.</p>

<p>Javier and Yu-Shuan&rsquo;s wedding was a blast. It is so amazing to see a relationship like theirs (with the cultural differences and personality differences) being lived out to God&rsquo;s glory. Wow. All the older figures in my life have been quickly marrying (Dave &amp; Janelle, Bruce &amp; Connie, Javier &amp; Yu-Shuan&hellip;)</p>

<p>I have an unusually chill finals schedule this semester. Mainly because my techs are project classes, and I really enjoy studying for my MC classes and writing papers. Trust me, when you&rsquo;ve been this long on the other side of the fence&hellip;</p>

<p>What a strangely wonderful semester. I&rsquo;ll tell you more about it&hellip; but give me a week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been awhile since I&rsquo;ve felt the way I did this morning.</p>

<p>I
was talking to a good friend last week about how it&rsquo;s so easy to be
discouraged in our failures and how we read about being &ldquo;freed from
sin&rdquo; but still at times, feel soundly enslaved. We wanna be transformed
by you, Jesus, but dang it&rsquo;s no easy road.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m glad the
prayer team&rsquo;s been talking about grace &mdash; how little we understand
about it, how much fuller and amazing it is if we&rsquo;d stop and fully
understand how, or more importantly, why
it was given to us. And how beautiful it is that &ldquo;where sin increased,
grace increased all the more&hellip;&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t figure it out, Jesus.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s
weird, because that&rsquo;s how You&rsquo;re breaking my addictions. Where I wanna
run and hide all my pockmarks, blemishes and moral failures away in my
closet, your light exposes it and your freakin&#8217; bountiful Grace covers
it. And when your Light shines, everything is revealed for what it
really is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been awhile since I&rsquo;ve felt the way I did this
morning&mdash;disappointed by how my habitual sin no longer satisfied the
way it used to. And realizing, yeah, God, you&rsquo;re releasing the chains.
You&rsquo;re setting me free.</p>

<p>My CS group was eating together last
night and the topic came across our ethnic names. Nobody&rsquo;s asked me
this for years, and I had almost forgotten. My Chinese name (<img src="http://www.mandarintools.com/cgi-bin/ugif/6069.gif" alt="" /><img src="http://www.mandarintools.com/cgi-bin/ugif/5149.gif" alt="" />) means
&ldquo;grace&rdquo; and &ldquo;light&rdquo;. Man, that hits me hard.</p>

<p>from a romans book:</p>

<p>You see, at just the right time, when
we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will
anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might
possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this:
While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p>&hellip;where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so that, just as
sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness
to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thank you, all of you. It was after large group maybe three weeks ago, when we all went to the Asian Ghetto to grab some grub. I spotted Mike at the corner and after talking for a bit, we went to get a chicken plate from Mandarin House (he hadn&rsquo;t eaten most for much of the day).</p>

<p>But he was staggering&mdash;looking distracted, unfocused and complaining of arm pains. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than it usually is,&rdquo; he told me. He couldn&rsquo;t eat as he was clenching his left forearm every couple of seconds or so.</p>

<p>I asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital. He had to pause and think for a few minutes&mdash;&ldquo;Naw, man, you got things to do tonight. I&rsquo;ll go later tonight.&rdquo; I had to insist.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s where I am thankful. I didn&rsquo;t have a car, but Justin was there in the court and went to get his car and drive. And the rest of you&mdash;a group of about six&mdash;just simply came walking out of the court and simply asked, &ldquo;Mike, can we pray for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That really moved me, guys. You all layed hands on him and prayed. And that moment I had a realization that this is the kingdom of God, coming down to earth at this moment. We were praying&mdash;Mike, you, me&mdash;; with simple faith &amp; in the able healing hands of our Father.</p>

<p>Justin pulls up and we head off to Highland Hospital. Mike heads straight into the ER (the staff know him there) and we head home.</p>

<p>I found Mike the next day. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d given me the wrong medication last time, Drew,&rdquo; he tells me. &ldquo;They forgot my iron pills.&rdquo; He shows me the papers. &ldquo;They renewed my Medicare too. My prescription&rsquo;s good for another six months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friends showed me love last night, Drew. Kept me going.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Fast forward three weeks to tonight, and I see Mike again on the street (only this time I&rsquo;m a little ashamed to approach him &mdash; the past three weeks I&rsquo;ve been too busy to see him). He eyes me (I suppose he&rsquo;s trying to make out my face in the darkness) and we slap palms. &ldquo;How you doin&#8217;, Drew? How was your Thanksgiving?&rdquo; I mumble some sort of excuse.</p>

<p>Mike gets excited, his voice rising and quickening. &ldquo;There was this guy messin&#8217; the place up last night. Big guy, young.&rdquo; Mike is gesturing at his shoulders, indicating the breadth of this man&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;A Cal student. He came in here six o&#8217;clock in the morning on Monday and starting kicking things over. Tables, trays, everything, making a mess. He went in that place&mdash;(gesturing at the Yokohama Station restaurant)&mdash;messed up the place then went to the next place and started kicking things over too. Tried to take out a window or two. I heard about it and came out here the next day at 6AM and waited for him. He didn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike sits down on an overturned paint can, pulls his hood tighter over his head and continues:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday he comes back again, 12:30 noon when everybody&rsquo;s here. He walks back into Yokohama Station and starts beating up the Chinese guy and his wife. You could here it from way out here, &lsquo;stop it! stop it!&rsquo;. I run in there and go &lsquo;hey what you doin&rsquo; man?&lsquo; The guy&rsquo;s throwing around chairs and tea cups and salt and pepper shakers. He&rsquo;s socking the Chinese guy in the face, and everybody&rsquo;s screaming from way out here.&rdquo; Mike stands up and acts it out: &ldquo;I throw the guy down&mdash;boom!&mdash;and he&rsquo;s down and he tries to get up again, so I pull his legs out from under him and the Chinese guy and me, we hold him down. I look him in the face and I recognize him &mdash; he used to come and put change in my cup. Tell him &#8216;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pick up my jaw from the floor. &ldquo;That happened yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, yesterday. Now everybody loves me. They tell me, &lsquo;you did a good thing, Mike.&rsquo; Cops take the guy to jail&mdash;tell me he say he&rsquo;ll be back. But whoo, everybody loves me now. The lady make me some broccoli beef yesterday and tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know what &mdash; I got approved for disability&mdash;they tell me to just wait a while, be patient, but it&rsquo;s coming. I don&rsquo;t need a lawyer no more. Got a bunch of people ahead of me in line, but that check be coming soon. Gonna get me off these streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mumble something like a &ldquo;wow.&rdquo; Cuz I&rsquo;m seriously amazed. God, you&rsquo;re providing. You&rsquo;re doing it. Wow.</p>

<hr />

<p>(Does anybody have a pair of men&rsquo;s gloves? Mike&rsquo;s asked for a pair cuz it gets cold at night. Let me know if you have one, thanks)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>She is retracing her steps, left over right and front over back. holding herself tight to keep from shuddering in the brisk nighttime chill. It is dusk, and the crowd of waiting riders is growing impatient. The 51 bus never comes on time.</p>

<p>She is retracing her steps in three-four, illuminated by a single streetlight, swaying over each corner of sidewalk tile. She is studying the ground in full concentration, because she can&rsquo;t quite remember where she is.</p>

<p>I cannot see her face, but know she is plainly beautiful.</p>

<p>She is mesmerizing: off to the side, under the awning, waltzing by herself, retracing her steps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mike called me on Sunday while I was at Fall Conference. &ldquo;How you been man?&rdquo; he asked me, &ldquo;I was just flippin through my phone book and thought of you.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>This weekend I was slowly beginning to realize how amazing it is to live with hope. Hope for myself, hope for broken relationships, hope for healing, hope found in community, hope out of brokenness, hope into transformation. It&rsquo;s so freaking beautiful, this surrendering thing.</p>

<hr />

<p>I walked past a girl walking out of the men&rsquo;s room at Evans today with a mortified look on her face. I stopped myself from making a witty comment and just gave her the biggest smile I could.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m terrible at maintaining relationships. Sure, I know tons of people, but I can&rsquo;t very well say that I play an active role in maintaining them. It should worry me a lot more than it does now.</p>

<p>For example, I never call my parents&hellip; it just never crosses my mind.</p>

<p>In high school, I rarely talked to my sisters (this was partially because I was always off doing something or the other. But that&rsquo;s no excuse). It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t love them. They just don&rsquo;t often cross my mind (and revealing this in this public space is kind of scary for me).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very good at withdrawing and keeping to myself. I&rsquo;m very good at neglecting relationships with people if they don&rsquo;t make an effort to maintain the relationship.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a side effect of the constant doing-ness that I&rsquo;ve been immersed in from junior high on, but it worries me. That I can duck into my own world for days at a time and completely ignore the network of friends, family and community.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sometimes apathetic towards relationships (the romantic ones). I worry that, well, I just won&rsquo;t care enough to maintain the relationship (does that sound arrogant?).</p>

<p>Sometimes, I just don&rsquo;t care enough. Can I admit that? I know, it makes me sound like a monster. And I&rsquo;m not very sure how much to attribute to my personality and how much to simple selfishness.</p>

<p>I knowï¿½on some head-knowledgey levelï¿½that a paucity of expressive love is due to never having experienced its fullness before. I&rsquo;m still trying to understand Abba&rsquo;s love. I&rsquo;m still building my vocabulary, still learning its language.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not just in that abstract level either. I&rsquo;m learning from everyday expressions of friendship, from homeboys who still keep in touch through email. I&rsquo;m learning from observing a community pouring out on each other. I&rsquo;m trying to savor the moments when I stop and realize that this exact moment was a gift, a freakin&#8217; amazing gift.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m in this process of having that ol&#8217; heart of stone transformed into that fleshy one. Jesus, show me how to love (in the myriad of infinite ways) as You do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a side effect of last night&rsquo;s code jam was a complete. brain. shutdown.</p>

<p>My CS prof gave me a funny look when I walked in to turn in my group report and asked if I was all right. I turned around, couldn&rsquo;t think of what to say, so I just walked out.</p>

<p>Then in MC102 discussion I started to say something then realized I really didn&rsquo;t have anything to say (but kept talking nonetheless). Do you ever have one of those out-of-body moments when you start talking and then cognitively realize you&rsquo;re hearing your own voice and get somewhat mesmerized by it? Like, wow, I&rsquo;m talking and that&rsquo;s my voice and&hellip; it sounds like nonsense. Luckily I crashed the plane in a recoverable fashion and shut up for the rest of section.</p>

<p>I was going to skip 162 lecture today but my GSI saw me and I couldn&rsquo;t walk out on him. So I napped on my arm. Best nap ever.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll take out my contacts now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trip,&rdquo; Mike tells me as we lean against Gypsys&#8217; restaurant, &ldquo;watching that guy do his thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>James, an African-American man dressed in jeans and a nylon jacket, is shaking the cup in front of the Asian Ghetto. He&rsquo;s singing something akin to a gospel spiritual. I say help a friend, I say helllp a friend with the charm and gusto of a stage performer. His voice is rich and boomy, but more impressively he continues to sing as people pass him by. Just a lil bit of change, I say, help a friend.</p>

<p>Mike just shakes his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trip cuz I&rsquo;m seeing it from the outside. And I&rsquo;m watching all these people passin&#8217; and, I dunno man, it&rsquo;s such a trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is an unwritten rule for working a spot. Once somebody has arrived, the place is in his possession until he leaves. A part of this is practical, because two people working the same spot means half the earnings. A part of this is simply being honorable to the livelihood of the other man.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first time I asked Mike if I could pray for him, I was surprised by the immediacy of his response and the quickness by which he grabbed my hand and bowed his head. We prayed with our hands clasped in some sort of handshake.</p>

<p>I found Mike talking to another student one night. It turned out he was from the Navigators fellowship. I asked him if we could pray for Mike together. He agreed, and we both clasped our hands around Mike&rsquo;s, praying God&rsquo;s healing, mercy and love over our brother. People were laughing at the sight, but let me tell you it was beautiful.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for me to believe in those sorts of prayers, especially with the realities of life that Mike faces daily. I tend to think that Mike has greater faith than I do. He told me a week later, &ldquo;You know Drew, whenever people pray for me, the pain stops. God bless me, Drew. He&rsquo;s working.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Mike&rsquo;s medication prescription has expired, leaving him without his nitroglycerine pills (in addition to his water pills and his iron pills). He gives me a call one day in class, and I pick up to hear his light drawl over the phone. &ldquo;Listen, man, Andrew, I need to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His temporary Medicare coverage has expired (it was a 90-day pass), leaving him without the ability to pay for his prescription meds held for him at Highland County Hospital in Oakland. &ldquo;Andrew, I need some twenty-five bucks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stop when I hear this over the phone. You see, Mike has this vibe that he wants my company more than he wants my money. That&rsquo;s what I like about him. But this is important, and I have no time to doubt his intentions so I tell Mike I can meet him later that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew, you&rsquo;re my real partner&rdquo; (Mike drawls partner into pardner) he tells me as we meet at dusk. I don&rsquo;t know how to respond to that.</p>

<p>He gets the meds and prescription that night (&ldquo;The doctor goes down to the pharmacy, the pharmacy&rsquo;s closed but he gets my meds for me anyways&rdquo;). His shakes and flutters have gone away for now, he tells me. Good, I tell him.</p>

<hr />

<p>I don&rsquo;t know Mike&rsquo;s last name. It&rsquo;s certainly crossed my mind that should Mike pass away, I should find out on some sort of public database. But I don&rsquo;t know his last name, and the possibility of death haunts me (particularly after not seeing him in front of his typical place in front of the Asian Ghetto for awhile). I don&rsquo;t know Mike&rsquo;s last name, because to me he&rsquo;s Mike, his estranged wife is Belinda, his cousin is Cal and somehow that is enough for him.</p>

<p>Note to self: find out Mike&rsquo;s last name.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mike bounces around from relative to relative, moving as often as they&rsquo;ll let him stay. Oftentimes he&rsquo;ll be kicked out because his relative&rsquo;s &ldquo;baby momma&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t like him, or because his sister&rsquo;s financial situation was worse than his own. He comes in to sleep at 12AM and leaves as early as possible, often at 6AM. He&rsquo;s currently staying with cousin Cal, who has acquired a &ldquo;crazy girl&rdquo; as described by Mike. She has taken a liking to Cal&hellip; and Mike. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t getting intimate with her&rdquo; Mike tells me with a fiery look in his eyes. Cousin Cal thinks differently. &ldquo;Hey cuz,&rdquo; he tells Mike, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you spend some time with her?&rdquo; Mike laughs. &ldquo;That girl crazy.&rdquo; He laughs some more. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding true to my word.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Mike&rsquo;s been to prison before, for some petty crimes and finally to the big house in 1986 for selling weed on a street corner to a man who turned out to be an undercover cop. &ldquo;I regret every one of those decisions&rdquo; he tells me. He was engaged to Belinda in 86 with a child and one on the way (if I can remember correctly). &ldquo;I can still remember that day I went out to sell. Belinda was calling out to me telling me to go straight. Worst decision of my life.&rdquo; After the arrest, he spent 10 years in the big house, San Quentin. &ldquo;I never got to see my children grow up. And now I can&rsquo;t see them anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>As previously mentioned, I suspect that much of the reason why I like Mike and have hit it off so well is because he&rsquo;s rarely directly asked me for money.</p>

<p>Mike calls me up today. &ldquo;Andrew, man, I gotta talk to you man.&rdquo; He repeats himself: &ldquo;I need to talk to you man. I need some cash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the second time he&rsquo;s called and asked for cash. I begin to regret giving him my number, and the other million associated doubts flutter in my head again.</p>

<p>This request brought back some bad memories in my mind of previous
encounters with other men on the streets who have taken advantage of me. More doubts flutter in my mind. Am I being a softie? He&rsquo;s probably gonna get some more booze with that change. He&rsquo;s no different from the others.</p>

<p>And I want to, at that moment,
hang up on Mike. I hesitate, for maybe a moment too longï¿½</p>

<p>I remember that my God, who knew that I&rsquo;d abuse his grace and mercy far ahead of time, died for me anyways. Did it cheapen his death? No, it amplified my need for Himï¿½</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew, I need the cash for my niece&rsquo;s birthday tomorrow. I&rsquo;m gonna go over to Walgreens and get her a doll. I wanna be there for her birthday, man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can I trust this man? I ask myself. Does it even matter, in light of what I&rsquo;ve done for you? God gently reminds me.</p>

<p>I meet with Mike that night (he comes to Berkeley on the BART) and give him some money. It is one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve ever done, because my doubts about him are still there. I&rsquo;m still feeling the fool for handing over cash to Mike, a man I could possibly call a friend but who is so removed from my universe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You show me so much love, Drew.&rdquo; He grips my hand hard. I am reluctant to return his embrace.</p>

<p>I walk back to a dull throb in my head, afraid that this will have been like every other time.</p>

<p>I walk slowly, pondering Grace.</p>
