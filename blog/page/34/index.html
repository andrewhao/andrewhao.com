  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have friends who run a cost-benefit analysis on every decision. And they&rsquo;re always measuring things up against Time. Freakin, Endless, Time. I think I&rsquo;m one of them, too. May it never be so.</p>

<hr />

<p>I remember why I&rsquo;ve never liked the stacks: these chairs are pretty much the least ergonomic chairs ever built, on par with medieval torture devices.</p>

<p>I remember why I&rsquo;ve missed the stacks: being here makes me feel smarter. And how time somehow seems to stands still, but that might be the artificial lighting and the fact I&rsquo;m fifty feet underground.</p>

<hr />

<p>There was a study done a long time ago where a woman volunteered to live underground for like a month. And they measured her sleep cycles, and it went wack by about a week (can anybody name this study or correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong?). I always wondered what kind of music you&rsquo;d listen to if you were underground for that long. And if she ever figured out how to work a Rubik&rsquo;s cube. Being underground for that long seems like a good way to determine cube optimization strategies.</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh, essay. The closer I get to the end, the harder it gets to write. 9 pages down, three to go and I&rsquo;ll either finish in one hour or in six.</p>

<p>Edit: it was six.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&rsquo;m writing the first part of my International Media paper on the structures of the media systems in Taiwan. Just wanted to share with you what I&rsquo;ve been coming across in my research so far:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://taiwanfeed.com/">aggregate blog</a> of many of the main English blogs on/in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, many of the high-visibility English political <a href="http://michaelturton.blogspot.com/">blog</a>s have heavy DPP rhetoric where many of my 1.5-gen Taiwanese friends at school and back home lean blue. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to discover where native Taiwanese political pundits/bloggers lean.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://taiwanperspective.blogspot.com/index.html">photo blogger</a> posts photos from the perspective of a foreigner in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Portnoy Zheng, a Taiwanese graduate student <a href="http://workingman.wordpress.com/">keeps a blog</a> (this is his lesser-updated English blog) on Taiwanese media with a particular Web emphasis.</p>

<p>I am also following another interesting conversation regarding Taiwanese bloggers&mdash;the complaint that the English and Taiwanese blog communities are largely independent of one another. <a href="http://michaelturton.blogspot.com/">Michael Turton</a> describes the need to unify the two realms:</p>

<blockquote><p>For me the major challenge is going to be bringing the Chinese-language and English language blogospheres together, because they have much to say to one another, and because Taiwanese bloggers need to get more recognition.</p></blockquote>

<p>Scott Sommers largely agrees <a href="http://scottsommers.blogs.com/taiwanweblog/2007/02/michael_turton_.html">in his post</a>, but more interesting is the meta section of his entry where there is a lively debate on who needs to take the first step: English- or Chinese-speaking bloggers. One commenter proposes considering the hegemonic properties of Western values:</p>

<blockquote><p>In my opinion, if English readers can answer these two questions, then maybe they might understand.<br/>
1. Why is it one can not export American-styled democracy anywhere, no matter how good the intention?<br/>
2. Why is it certain missionaries, churches, or faiths are more accepted then others; even when their messages are the same?</p></blockquote>

<p>Portnoy Zheng (previously mentioned), believes the problem is <a href="http://workingman.wordpress.com/2006/04/23/about-regional-blogger-aggregator/#comments">less about hegemony than it is about language</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is nothing about English hegemony; it is about how to communicate
effectively,how to break the language divide, and how to enhance our
understanding of our neighbors.</p></blockquote>

<p>Interestingly enough, there is a movement towards an <a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2007/02/join_the_open_s.html">Open Source Translation Project</a> which is calling for volunteers to translate Chinese blogs (not limited to TW) to English and vice versa. The implications here could be enormous, not just for Taiwanese blogs but for the Chinese web audience as well.</p>

<p>Finally, Tony Chung is a composer, songwriter and <a href="http://tonelisten.com/">pop singer</a> in <a href="http://www.wretch.cc/blog/tonelisten">Taiwan</a>. He also happens to be from San Jose. He also happens to run a <a href="http://www.geekwhat.com">tech blog</a> and a <a href="http://www.talkmatic.com">Web 2.0 podcast show</a>, recently covered by tech blogger, <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/02/15/neat-meeting-of-the-day-tony-chung/">Robert Scoble</a>. Not to mention he also was ASB president my sophomore year in high school. Go check him out and support him. Best to you, Tony (er, Tone?).</p>

<p>AND I need to get back to work (yunno, actually writing).</p>

<p>I chose E*Trade. Their website is prettier.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, time to let it out again.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t stopped long enough to process how I&rsquo;ve been, but here off the top of my head, I&rsquo;ve been well. Really. Getting full chunks of shut-eye, fully rested from my month-long bout with the cold and staying afloat in my classes.</p>

<p>This semester has been a different one. Turning twenty-one had a little to do with it, but I sense more of it has come with a slow realization of who I am, a sort of painful self-awareness that I&rsquo;m&hellip; arriving. Contrary to my initial suspicions, it&rsquo;s actually a good feeling.</p>

<p>(Admission: After getting over the shock of a month&rsquo;s worth of facial hair, I think it&rsquo;s growing on me, pun intended.)</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m asking the wrong question but&mdash;When do you give up on a friend living without hope? I want to show him; shake him out of it, do anything that will revive him. Maybe that&rsquo;s his personality, maybe I&rsquo;m just naive. Regardless, it&rsquo;ll be a matter of time before the numbness sets in (man, this is super-cynical).</p>

<p>Romans is pretty much blowing me away. Paul lays it out raw. I can imagine the apostle pacing in a room, drafting his thoughts in his head. Look, he is trying to form the right words, can you understand peace? The thought is overwhelming. At the apex of our God-hatred, he died so that we may have peace. Peace, undeserved, is merciful, extravagant favor. The apostle hears his heart beating to the humble, Kingly beauty of it all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;I called you, Drew, but you didn&rsquo;t pick up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I confess, I tend to ignore Mike&rsquo;s phone calls. He&rsquo;ll invariably call me in class or sometimes the call will get dropped instantly when it comes in. I use these as excuses to hang up on him. But it&rsquo;s mostly because I know what a phone call means (it usually means he needs money).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m at the Asian Ghetto (Durant Food Court, to be PC) with Glen on Friday evening when I run into Mike. He&rsquo;s called me earlier in the night during IV large group and I had to hang up on him because I couldn&rsquo;t excuse myself. Okay, I didn&rsquo;t want to take the call either. He left me a voice mail, which I haven&rsquo;t checked when I see Mike in person a couple hours later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drew, I called you but you didn&rsquo;t pick up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mumble some sort of apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to this voice mail.&rdquo; He calls his own number and has me listen to a voice message. A man with a gravelly voice has called Mike and offered him a job as a service assistant to a disabled person. &ldquo;I meet with him 10AM tomorrow,&rdquo; Mike tells me with a pained expression on his face.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m confused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I called you, Drew, but you didn&rsquo;t pick up. Look man, I need some cash. Last few offers I got I couldn&rsquo;t do cuz they wanted me to have a car.&rdquo; He continues to talk about his previous experiences as a health assistant, especially with a disabled family member. &ldquo;Look man, my family got issues. I can&rsquo;t depend on them. I come up to Berkeley cuz I know I can depend on people here. I can depend on you college students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish Mike wouldn&rsquo;t talk so much so I could get a word in edgewise. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t know what to say. This time, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>

<p>Depend is the last word I want to hear. I don&rsquo;t want him to depend on me. It brings up too many bad experiences. It makes me feel like a crutch. It makes me feel used. It brings up questions of codependency I don&rsquo;t want to consider.</p>

<p>But I give him money. &ldquo;Look man, I&rsquo;m doing this cuz you&rsquo;re my friend. I trust you.&rdquo; I know he needs the money for bus fare. But it&rsquo;s tearing me up inside because I wonder if all I am is an ATM machine to Mike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks Drew. I love you.&rdquo; We pray.</p>

<p>Walking back up, I share these thoughts with Glen. He tells me his pastor&rsquo;s story of offering help to a stranger in need who, in the end, is fleeced. The pastor doesn&rsquo;t harden his heart, but again gives generously the next time around. For who is he, in light of incredible grace, to claim the right to his money?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I totally agree or understand. But it is comforting at the moment. And who am I, humbled in light of stunning Mercy, to declare myself independent of a broken world?</p>

<p>(His last name is Harris. Michael Harris.)</p>
