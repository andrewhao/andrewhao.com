  <div class="entry-content"><p>So Hsiu-fan and I had floated the idea of doing a hack for <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hacku/">Yahoo! University Hack Day</a>. We had even polled some of our friends about it, and the consensus seemed to be &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what we can do with the time we&rsquo;re given.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well it turned out we didn&rsquo;t have very much time. Today I opened up my email inbox to discover that Hack Day was today, and the actual time to hack was only from 2PM to 6PM.</p>

<p>So I head on over to the Woz with the intention of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Eating free food</p></li>
<li><p> Grabbing a t-shirt or two</p></li>
<li><p> Talking to some of the Yahoo! devs</p></li>
<li><p> Giving a couple of hours as a freelance developer.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>While I easily managed to achieve #1, 2 and 3, #4 (joining a random group) was something that I didn&rsquo;t expect to do.</p>

<p>Hsiu-Fan showed up half-way through the competition and told me &ldquo;Okay, I have 50 minutes. What do you want to do?&rdquo; We had floated the idea of doing the <a href="http://blog.g9labs.com/2007/08/10/thinking-about-writing-a-rhapsody-scrobbler/">Rhapsody scrobbler</a>. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he tells me. &ldquo;I think I can do that in 50 minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But by then, I&rsquo;ve been snagged by this other group, composed of folks mainly from the <a href="http://csua.berkeley.edu">CS Undergrad Association</a>. The idea? The creation of a <strong>commuter Web application</strong> that would take peoples&#8217; commute details and sort them into carpools based on convenience.</p>

<p>The problem? These guys were serious Java heads. I was the lone Web developer. We were going to have problems. Fortunately we managed to hash out a somewhat working hack using the skill sets that we had.</p>

<p>Okay, it was a &ldquo;hack&rdquo; in every sense of the word. The other guys didn&rsquo;t want to implement a database (which means no locking, no synchronization). I was parsing browser inputs through PHP and writing them out to a flat file. Then something got slurped by our Java backend and requests were shot back and forth between Yahoo! Maps and our service. Then the resulting routes were written out to a flat file and a PHP script consumed it on demand, displaying calculated routes.</p>

<p>My job? I was the frontend guy, interface guy, PHP guy, and client-side guy. I put together a pretty quick-and-dirty interface (see below) using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">YUI grids and reset</a>. Then I did a pretty massive Frankenstein CSS job, piecing bits of code from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint CSS framework</a>, previous projects and <a href="http://www.wejoinin.com">Wejoinin</a>.</p>

<p>(Aside: If there&rsquo;s one thing I appreciate about a CSS framework, it&rsquo;s the flexibility and speed it affords you. I love, particularly with Blueprint (which I would have preferred to use on this project but didn&rsquo;t because it <em>is</em> a Yahoo! Hack Day), the ability to lay out a grid-based layout using CSS selectors in a fraction of the time it takes you to build it again from scratch.)</p>

<p>Then I took a deep breath and summoned up enough of the PHP left in the recesses of my brain.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Hsiu-Fan didn&rsquo;t manage to finish the Scrobbler on time (50 minutes was pretty optimistic), but we&rsquo;re looking into finishing it up sometime, somewhere else. And it will be cool and we will feel fuzzy.</p>

<h4>Hack day lessons</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Come in with a cool idea with a cool team ready to execute. Don&rsquo;t assemble something together last minute.</p></li>
<li><p>Yahoo! cares more about people that are passionate than  about people who  have impressive resumes.</p></li>
<li><p>Your project idea should be limited enough in scope to be polished.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if your team strengths don&rsquo;t align well, you&rsquo;ll always find a way to do [your hack].</p></li>
<li><p>Come on, Yahoo!, could we get a little more than 4 hours to finish? :)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, a bunch of fun. I&rsquo;d definitely do it again. And I&rsquo;d pray that I&rsquo;d have a little more time to execute. And hope that people don&rsquo;t give me any more weird looks when I tell them I was at a &ldquo;programming contest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash; Edit:</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rckenned/1646789668/in/set-72157602538180791/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2368/1646789668_342a79679b_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<blockquote><p>Berkeley Hack Day happened Friday at a frenetic pace.  We invaded the Woz in Soda Hall and students were trickling in and out all day with a core group of four hack teams staying for the duration and a couple of teams working remotely.  The teams fought Java, Python, C++ and PHP all day long, with Java defeating at least a couple of team members with its multiple layers of input streams required just to pull in a simple text file.  We also fought with RSS feeds from Craigslist, news archives and local Berkeley event listings.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the end it was a very close race between two hacks that rose above the rest: an extremely useful carpool commuter application that matched up peoples&#8217; addresses and their daily destinations and tried to organize the most efficient combination of carpools, and a magnificent hack that provided a cell phone interface to the old game of Twenty Questions.  The impressive mix of technologies required to answer the call automatically, acquire the data for the twenty questions, do the text-to-speech translation and issue the FFT code to decipher the user responses from the cell phone won over the judges to take the top prize.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>I.  When the restlessness again enters my legs</strong></p>

<p>We dare do what mere men dare not! We linger in the rain when mothers worldwide would frown, wagging their fingers at us children lollydallying in the puddles, stomping on muddy daisies, the rain soaking our pores. We run exclusively when it&rsquo;s wet, through throngs of umbrellaed passerbys who cluck their tongues and shake their heads. And when it grows dark, we swim and splash through rivers running in the streets, if only because we can, because we could, because we can. The restlessness enters my legs when the sky begins to pour. We must rebel, we must run.</p>

<p><strong>II. On the sensation of rain</strong></p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t do anything to rain. It can only mess you up; it can only soak you. Have you ever heard the trees fight the rain? They try to hold the drops in their leaves; at night you can hear the cacophony of each drop. The torrents will never cease, but the trees hold out their arms and try to drink the sky. It is the same with us (we can bat at one drop but ten more take its place). We can do nothing but steel our gaze, brace our bodies and drink the sky.</p>

<p>(There is a valiant eucalyptus grove the length of Dwinelle.)</p>

<p><strong>III.  On fighting</strong></p>

<p>Keep your heart rate up. Left foot, right foot, left. When you reach intersections, jog in place. Blink often.</p>

<p><strong>IV. The sender</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>10 As the rain and the snow
come down from heaven,
and do not return to it
without watering the earth
and making it bud and flourish,
so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater,</p></blockquote>

<p>11 so is my word that goes out from my mouth:
It will not return to me empty,
but will accomplish what I desire
and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.</p>

<p><strong>V. Its effects</strong></p>

<p>I return home, feeling unnaturally lucid and completely alive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&rsquo;m not quite sure what happened, but sometime between last night and this morning, I lost all the contacts in my cell phone. Was it some fluke? A stray cosmic ray collided with a memory cell? Did somebody reprogram my phone out of spite? All we can do is speculate.</p>

<p>So I probably don&rsquo;t have your number anymore (it&rsquo;s nothing personal). And how about the next time you call me, you save me the awkwardness of pretending to recognize you by telling me who you are? Thanksss.</p>

<h4>I&rsquo;m curious</h4>

<p>What would you do in this situation? Would you come up with some harebrained scheme to trick your friends into sending you their phone numbers? Would you rely on your keen hearing and amazing sense of intuition to guess the caller&rsquo;s identity? Would you just never answer your phone&hellip; ever? Maybe you&rsquo;d profusely apologize without ever saying a word? Or would you just Google your friends (in vain), hoping somebody, somewhere has mined their mobile phone numbers?</p>
