  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spot Mike when I drive up Durant Ave on Wednesday evening. I&rsquo;m not doing anything that night, so I figured I&rsquo;d spend some time and catch up with him.</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s squatting on a stack of empty milk crates. We slap palms, and he has this long look on his face. &ldquo;Andrew, she screwed me real bad&rdquo; is the first thing he tells me.</p>

<p>From what I can gather, Mike&rsquo;s family is a loose collection of friends, acquaintances, relatives and strangers. He&rsquo;s referring to his cousin&rsquo;s lady friend, who has been hanging around him for the past few days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the ATM and I step up to withdraw some cash. I see her looking over my shoulder&rdquo;&mdash;Mike&rsquo;s expression turns to a snarl&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Hey! What you doin&rsquo;?&lsquo;&rdquo;</em> Mike&rsquo;s expression relaxes a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyways, I&rsquo;m with her when we pass by the ATM again the next day and I stop to withdraw some more money. Only I pull out my wallet and my ATM card&rsquo;s not there. <em>Where did I put it?</em> She stays and I go back home to look for the card. I tell Belinda, <em>Where did I put that card?</em> and she says it ain&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s shaking his head, staring blankly into space. <em>She jacked me up real bad</em>.  A guy walks out of the alley and drops some change into Mike&rsquo;s cup. Mike springs onto his feet and into his thank-you routine. <em>Thank you brother, God bless you</em>. He drops back onto the milk crates with a heaviness I can feel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I got my card replaced and they find that I don&rsquo;t have no more money in my account. Somebody withdrew 350 dollars that day, and it was her. I know it. She got my card. She took 350 dollars and left me nineteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shuffle around on the asphalt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyways I go over to her house and start yellin&#8217; at her to get my money back. <em>I didn&rsquo;t do it</em>, she yellin&#8217; back at me and I&rsquo;m like <em>Yeah you did.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>People are filing in and out of the Asian Ghetto pretty rapidly. It&rsquo;s Wednesday night on a cool summer day and students are out in force. Not many make eye contact with Mike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She took my money and jacked my bike, too,&rdquo; Mike continues. &ldquo;I come home the other day to see her throw down my bike in the driveway.&rdquo; He holds up his hands to pantomime the action, &ldquo;She throw it down with a <em>CRASH</em> and she just walks away. I find out she slice up my tires too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had a bike that nice before.&rdquo; Mike launches into a story of how he bought the bike off of a UC Berkeley student, then falls silent. &ldquo;She jack me real bad, Drew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody&rsquo;s stopping, but then I catch a group of friends walking up who will. Brian, one of them, stops and greets Mike (they know each other well). Another, Christine, stops to listen. And Mike is again telling his story.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m realizing that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too busy&rdquo; is a pathetic, pathetic little answer.</p>

<hr />

<p>Eh, I haven&rsquo;t kept folks updated on my love life. It&rsquo;s something I used to be totally candid about, but somehow I&rsquo;ve been less willing to talk about it (online and in person) maybe because I feel like the pressure has increased in these last few years.</p>

<p>I usually give folks one of two answers when asked about my love life:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve actually really been growing as a single dude and haven&rsquo;t really felt the need to get a girlfriend yet. I&rsquo;m <em>really</em> satisfied in Jesus.&rdquo; Some days I&rsquo;ll really mean it. And some days I&rsquo;ll fake my best smile.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Soon&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll give you a vague smile to make you think like I have a plan to ask this girl out in the next few days or weeks or years. I just won&rsquo;t tell you specifics.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve never been in a relationship before?&rdquo; People will usually repeat this aloud to themselves (maybe they don&rsquo;t believe me), then they tend to stare at me in this quizzical, critical, <em>impatient</em> manner like I&rsquo;m a zillion miles behind in the EQ Olympic Sprint/Marathon.</p>

<p>_A recollection slightly tangential to the point I&rsquo;m making:
_</p>

<p>I was painfully awkward in elementary school leading into 7th grade. I covered this up with a smiley nice-guy persona. Totally harmless. Totally spineless. Pretty darn shy, especially around girls. I theoretically knew they existed. They even seemed to be in my classes. Too bad I never really talked to any of them, much less made friends with them. My first conversation with a g1rl was in the seventh grade. It lasted about 10 seconds and I was so proud of myself.</p>

<p>_End recollection slightly tangential to the point I&rsquo;m making.
_</p>

<p>High school was better, but not by much. I figure out that girls aren&rsquo;t so intimidating after all. I even made friends with a few, and had crushes on a fair share of them.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s pair this still-awkward, more-or-less robotic interactions I have with girls <em>and</em> let&rsquo;s couple it with the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t date in high school-<em>or-else</em>&rdquo; mentality that&rsquo;s pretty prevalant in the Asian church (that&rsquo;s a another story) and you have a recipe for the &ldquo;let&rsquo;s be <em>friends</em> but keep our distance so that we won&rsquo;t raise the chances of developing feelings/become codependent/be distracted from studies/fatally fall in love/make babies/drink from the flask of heartbreak too soon&rdquo; mentality.</p>

<p>_(To be continued&hellip;!) _</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m different. It&rsquo;s been about three weeks since the realization washed over me. I wish I had the vocabulary to tell you about it. But to tell you the truth, it&rsquo;s pretty foggy to me as well. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve held off on posting out here&mdash;every time I think I have something distilled and clear in my head, something muddles it up.</p>

<p>Something&rsquo;s different. I can taste the change in my thoughts, my interactions with people and my personality. I don&rsquo;t quite like it. I feel older. More reserved. Slightly cynical (oh Lord no). Heavier.</p>

<p>I feel heavier, perhaps <em>wearier</em>. I bear bruises but I don&rsquo;t know where they come from.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll try to flesh it out in writing a little more in the next few days. I&rsquo;ll do my best to be transparent, but I&rsquo;ll probably hold back a little bit because of the nature of this medium. Please do ask me in person if you&rsquo;d like a fuller picture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a whole summer of not seeing Mike, I bumped into him last Friday at the Asian Ghetto.</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s been receiving his disability payments and so has been off the streets for a good three months or so, but got kicked out of the program last month for missing a doctor&rsquo;s appointment. So he&rsquo;s been out on the streets again shaking the cup until he can appeal.</p>

<p>I bumped into him on my way home last Friday and told him I&rsquo;d come right back out in a couple of hours to see him. &ldquo;Thanks Andrew, I love ya,&rdquo; he tells me before I go.</p>

<p>I promptly forgot that evening. Dang. Haven&rsquo;t seen him since, but something tells me we&rsquo;ll bump into each other again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been marinating in the idea of communities that display God&rsquo;s boundless grace. Brothers and sisters that care just as much about <em>who you are now</em> than <em>who you need to be</em>.</p>

<p>In Christian circles, I hear many stories of <em>victory</em>, of <em>conquering sin</em>, of <em>success</em>. It&rsquo;s done with much bravado&mdash;<em>it&rsquo;s finished! Sallgood! </em>And when they are genuine proclamations, we celebrate together.</p>

<p>And sometimes, I wonder if we trumpet the successes so loudly that we silence the revelation of our brokenness.</p>

<p>I came up with a few reasons why I didn&rsquo;t want to show people I was broken:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I would have to admit I suck.</p></li>
<li><p> Admitting I suck would somehow prove that God sucks.</p></li>
<li><p> Other people, once they saw me failing, would stop trying to be holy.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Let&rsquo;s say we had a Pastor Ted Haggard in our midst, the man whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Haggard">now-public</a> indiscretions took him down in a messy fireball of controversy and finger-pointing. Could Christian leaders have done better than to send him away to out-of-state Christian counseling (and months later deceptively declare him &ldquo;cured&rdquo;)? Who&rsquo;s fooling who?</p>

<p>What if the Christian community, full of <em>faithhopelove</em>, picked him up and walked with him? What if they pulled him further in instead of shoving him out?</p>

<p>The Church has a concern with holiness (and that is good). Can that happen while embracing brokenness&mdash;<em>in the light (1 Jn 1:5-10)</em>&mdash;naked, ugly, &amp; exposed?</p>
