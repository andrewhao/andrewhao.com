  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you lean too hard, you&rsquo;ll go tumbling out of shadows, into the lake. Look, like how the leaves strain against their cuffs in the wind, leaning into the goldenrod breeze. Look at the lovers lean into each other, racing against sundown, lips brushing freckles, freckles brushing blades tickling toes.</p>

<p>There is no time for thinking now, but the mechanical <em>slapslap</em> of feet against pavement. I can sum up Murakami&rsquo;s book: what does he think about when running? Nothing. Justin&rsquo;s been reading more about running lately and letting me read his books. I realize that I enjoy how mechanical it is: I like the forward lean, the rhythmic labor of breathing, driving forward, but not too far forward lest you tumble (where?). I&rsquo;ve been feeling more aggressive with my run form, enjoying the feeling of being <em>fast</em> and the brushing of warm rays on my back. It&rsquo;s going to get me in trouble._
_</p>

<p>I lean into the whoopsiedaisy turn lane and find that will be occupied in three-two-one but thankfully I reel back in and thank my lucky stars. A wandering Kia once leaned into me and gently lay my bike down in the bike lane. I am happy to report I didn&rsquo;t go down with it, but wondered in a few panicked moments if people would do their better thinking laying down.</p>

<p>With much sighing, a flock of photons once barreled into the earth in a lazy arc, leaving tendrils of dirt-dust in its wake. The sun bathed us in a lemonade glow in the evening&mdash;I tried to catch it in the viewfinder, but decided to let the moment stand silent, solemn by my side, the way you would imagine you would feel in one of those movie-moments pregnant with meaning, voiced by a steel guitar. On the way back from Portland I imagined just that, feeling like our car was the only one in the world, leaning into thin slices of daylight. I caught myself singing along to the stereo, and at that moment thought that we should drive to the world&rsquo;s edge, then go some more.</p>

<p>I had a hard time accepting it, but I finally have to admit that I&rsquo;m <em>afraid</em> to live in my new neighborhood.</p>

<p>We found out the other day that our place was robbed two months before we came in. There&rsquo;s a lot of characters that hang out around the liquor store down the street. I <em>think</em> there&rsquo;s a lot of unusual traffic at the house a few doors down. I&rsquo;m finding I&rsquo;m making assumptions about people by their race and ethnicity, and letting fear get in the way. It&rsquo;s nice to sit inside and not go out. Or go out, and not have to come back till late at night.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t hide behind lofty ideals, or mere words and lip service. This isn&rsquo;t easy, again. My fear is clouding everything, and it&rsquo;s taken me a few weeks to admit it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Regeneration interns and I are wrapping up our year here at church. What have I learned?</p>

<h3>This was the year I stopped romanticizing urban ministry.</h3>

<p>I honestly came in with the idea that I was going to be really warmhearted and be an amazing rescuer and friend of the poor who could really see peoples&#8217; humanity past their issues. Instead, I found myself bitter at a lot of folks. R, who was doing great in his alcohol recovery, stole from us. We banned M from sleeping on our porch steps because her sharp urine scent was too much. P sleeps in the bushes, but occasionally defecates in the lot. I learned to dread the sound of the doorbell, which meant inconveniencing me to run up and answer the door and heat up some food. I hated being inconvenienced.</p>

<p>I learned that the poor despise the rich with the lens of entitlement, and the rich despise the poor with a lens of laziness and deservedness. I now see the complex web of power structures, decadeslong injustices, and people that give up in the face of overwhelming difficulty. I wrestle a lot with a desire to escape and turn my back. I hesitate to press in. I know now, ever more than ever, that we both need Jesus to humble us and equalize us.</p>

<h3>This was a year of community</h3>

<p>Take our recent baptism from a couple of months ago. R*, an African-American member who has wrestled with a long history of alcoholism and other issues, was prayed over by P, an older white man, S, a hapa young professional, and Betty, a wheelchair-bound white lady. I looked at the picture and wondered what can explain this except the Gospel?</p>

<p>Or the time that Eric engineered a sled so that we could take Betty, wheelchair and all, down to Ocean Beach for a bonfire. What can explain that?</p>

<p>Or the times that we hit up In-n-Out at random times in the middle of the night, or did a monthly San Tung run, or chowed on Yummy Guide after a Betty dropoff. I&rsquo;m going to remember running trails with Nate, or swimming with Eric and Justin. And there was that one time that Eric did my chores for me while I worked on some programming project because he saw I was stressed. &lt;3.</p>

<h3>This was a year of slowing down</h3>

<p>I realized that I live from task to task and thrive on stress. I need to stop this. I know this because I feel really antsy if I go the whole day without knocking anything out from my todo list. I will literally feel like exploding.</p>

<p>We live in a world of to-do lists and Getting Things Done. I am learning to stop, chat, laugh, and listen.</p>

<h3>This was a year of humility.</h3>

<p>I never liked doing my cleaning chores, or being asked to do something that was really inconvenient to my schedule. But those service times were pretty sweet if I had the right attitude. I will say that I got a lot of sermons knocked out while scrubbing toilets.</p>

<h3>This was a year of getting better at people things</h3>

<p>&hellip;and not be so clueless with friendships and relationships &lsquo;n stuff.</p>

<h3>This was a year of recentering</h3>

<p>And in the end, I want Jesus&#8217; reality more than ever. I&rsquo;m learning that God&rsquo;s a good dad, and I can trust him.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Channeling Ice Cube:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>94610 prayer walk with church community. Gary shared that doing these walks builds hope in us&hellip; helps us remember there&rsquo;s hope for Oakland. Give us eyes and ears and a heart for the city and our neighborhood. And afterwards I bought a brioche knot + a pizza slice at Arizmendi and 2 peaches from the farmer&rsquo;s market. Freakin good.</p></li>
<li><p>Did a 35-mile loop from Regen to Lake Chabot and back via Skyline with Eric and a friend. Nothing but godawful fatigue at the end. Came back and passed out for a good while.</p></li>
<li><p>Microwave TJ curry for dinner + a diet Coke someone left in the fridge. Amazing.</p></li>
<li><p>Sent Betty back with Kylan. Today I didn&rsquo;t mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaned bathrooms and the kitchen, and enjoyed the alone time. Thought a lot about how I&rsquo;ve changed this year.</p></li>
<li><p>Sat out in the night air for a few minutes and just took it in.</p></li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it was about today but it just felt <em>good</em>. God&rsquo;s been good to me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/5769226387/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5769226387_4cd938676c.jpg" alt="Betty" /></a></p>

<p>The most difficult (and yet I suspect one of the most rewarding) part of this year&rsquo;s internship has been to simply sit with somebody and listen. Yes, it&rsquo;s been maddeningly difficult with Betty, the lady pictured above.</p>

<p>Ask anybody; I&rsquo;m a busy, hyper-scheduled guy. But to listen to someone is to really allow yourself to be inconvenienced. To let them stop you in the middle of a busy hall and hear them out, to let someone know that their ramblings about the most inane things really <em>matter</em> to you can really communicate care.</p>

<p>But how many people in our American culture really care to listen to one another? Or are we always running place to place, never stopping long enough to talk and hear each other out? Perhaps we&rsquo;re too busy shouting over each other.</p>

<p>More often than not, I&rsquo;m half-listening to Betty and half-plotting my escape from the conversation (she is masterful at grabbing for your ear and not letting go). But what if, as Carol Johnston once told us, we decided to listen, <em>really listen</em> with undivided attention, until the other person has nothing left to say?</p>

<p>Betty and I have this love-hate relationship. I think she fights with me more than any other person. &ldquo;I feel like you just want to dump me off at my place, like a piece of trash&rdquo; she snarled at me one week. I was so pissed. But it&rsquo;s true; when I talk to her I dream of not talking to her. I don&rsquo;t value her opinions like I would a friend&rsquo;s. (And she smells).</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve been challenged to listen to her and see past her toxicity and defenses. Love can cover a multitude of (my obnoxious) sins. I sat down with her one afternoon and did my best to hear her out for an hour. She was so pleasant that it scared me. People are saying that she&rsquo;s changing. Maybe it&rsquo;s because some people in my community are really making an effort to sit down with her, share a meal, give a ride, and lend an ear.</p>

<p>I remember,</p>

<p>Feeling the weight of heartbreaking silence slip through my fingers, pooling at our feet. It is thicker than water. Discovering that love must be coaxed &amp; wooed, and bearing the frustration of not knowing how. The pain of the real self left undiscovered; the throbbing, stinging disappointment you feel as a boy. The terror of shame that turns to bewildering anger. The loneliness you can know only when trapped in corners. The embarrassment of chopping an onion while everybody knows something you don&rsquo;t. A sadness that only a city knows.</p>

<p>and,</p>

<p>The lightness of a yellow-tinted memory. A B-flat tune, laughter, kind of blue. Bicycles, blitzing by. A father&rsquo;s familiar voice and recalling brushing my dad&rsquo;s rough 5 o&#8217;clock chin with my cheek as a boy, feeling its strength. The dewy dampness of her hair, like redwoods after a rain. The way you can still chuckle from a faraway memory, fading at the edges. Freedom is around the corner. The rough-hewn edges of the rugged cross. <em>Yahweh</em> is my father, he heard it once said then again, over and over. The gasps of children when they visit the zoo. The blueish melody of redemption songs. The solemn assembly of friends gathered in firelight. The noodles need more basil. Our tears are thicker than water, but they soon turn to a sort of flabbergasted joy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>you have come to us in royal fashion, your slippers triumphantly slapping against gravel, your elegant fingers drumming against our windowpanes. you keep up a good pace, sir. you glide alongside our car and smile your patented, ringmaster smile. we watch you through one-way tinted glass and air-conditioned cabins. you are a curious specimen, a caged animal proudly loping the length of your alley.</p>

<p>at this point you would expect us to roll down our windows and expose our foreign skin, salivating mouths and lusting faces. you have girls for us, young ones whose virginities and sexual prowess you tout loudly, in broken phrases and sentences.</p>

<p>you know us; men who come through for innocent interludes and escapades. we want to feel flesh against ours and imagine the whispers of past loves. others will inhale deeply of the choking, snarling scent of lust, leaving inkdrops suspended in an ever-darkening pool of water.</p>

<p>you know how desperately we prefer to believe that these girls want us. we operate in fantasies. you provide them for us; you are the sultan of sex and the purveyor of pleasure. you feel powerful: the kick you get in offering the services of your women is unmatched by the wide-eyed grins of your customers. men now boys, they are pressing their faces against glass, drooling over shiny toys in storefront windows.</p>

<p>doggedly you chase after cars. or they run after you. your fingernails clack against the windowpanes and offer what you know your customers want, even if they don&rsquo;t willingly realize it yet. you need us. you love us. you resent us.</p>

<p>you resent us because we come from outside and we take your women. you&rsquo;ve seen how we use them like cheap change. but you too have participated.</p>

<p>you are not yourself. you grew up in a rusting city, its long, rambling corridors locking you in to your quarter-peso life. your life has never been easy. this is the only way you know how to survive in this rotting place. you know it too, but to see your girls as human is exquisitely painful. they hold a mirror to you and at the corners you can make out the crumbling images of your sister and your mother.</p>

<p>you pretend not to notice how the girls thicken after each session. quickly they become armored fortresses, silk buttresses over bronzed skin. it is too humid here; you cannot keep the patina from running down their shoulders.</p>
