<p>I want to write a <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com">Rhapsody</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/help/">scrobbler</a>. It&rsquo;s already been done as a <a href="http://www.atlansky.com/dev/rhapsodyscrobbler.html">desktop application</a>, but I don&rsquo;t want to boot up another application while I&rsquo;m playing music.

<p>Does anybody want to look into this? I&rsquo;m thinking the design would be simple: regularly consume the Rhapsody user&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/myrhapsody/feeds.html">Tracks RSS feed</a> and plug it into AudioScrobbler via its <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/">API</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote yesterday about being in a suspension in between &ldquo;categories&rdquo; and figured it would do some good to clarify what&rsquo;s going on in my head.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take for example, my identity as a Christ-follower. There are, quite frankly, too many layers for me to deal with on my own:</p>

<blockquote><p>This year I&rsquo;ve found myself drawn to Reformed theology; finding my heart completely enamored with a God who rules rightly and justly and lovingly and wrathfully in a manner that is a dimension or six over what my human mind can comprehend. My friends in these circles talk about the beauty of the Gospel with so much passion. And yes, I&rsquo;m a closet John Piper fanboy.</p></blockquote>

<p>On another level, my involvement with InterVarsity on campus has opened up my eyes to the systemic injustices of this world and how the kingdom of God through Jesus is oriented to &ldquo;bind up the broken-hearted, proclaim freedom for the captives and release for the prisoners.&rdquo; This theologically liberal approach takes up social justice issues, calling attention to global crises (e.g. framing the suffering in Darfur as a moral issue), calling for political accountability (e.g. debt cancellation to Third world countries as a Biblical concept) and, on a local scale, simple acts of good deeds and justice towards the poor, homeless &amp; needy.</p>

<p>Many of my close friends and family have been Pentecostal folks, living out the realities of the Holy Spirit in everyday life. They <em>know</em> God is real because the Holy Spirit works in the every-day. I know I come into these things with more than a little cynicism, but I&rsquo;ve heard and seen more than enough to keep proof positive that the Holy Spirit works today in real, visible, tangible (and intangible) ways (&mdash;healings, miracles, knowledge, crazy out-there stuff). And man, have you ever seen anybody live out life more passionately than a Pentecostal? :D</p>

<p>And finally, a nod to my friends who are Emergent-type thinkers, who attempt to take a step back and examine the faith with post-modern tools of deconstruction. The more radical ones will talk about how words &amp; meanings are fluid. They&rsquo;ll do their best to reveal Jesus in a culturally-relevant light. These folks are about the holistic experience of the Divine&mdash;in terms of implementation, they experience Jesus in everything from art to dance to poetry to liturgy to YouTube. &ldquo;Hey&mdash;nobody likes &lsquo;religion&rsquo; so let&rsquo;s just tear it all down and start from the basics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that these camps can&rsquo;t be completely melded into One Awesome Theology because each one begins with a primary value over another. One begins with the Cross, the other begins with the Kingdom, the other begins with Pentecost and the other one, Culture.</p>

<p>But because I&rsquo;ve been hanging out in each corner, I see bits of God revealed in each (and, admittedly, see flaws in each, too). I&rsquo;ve heard it said that the Gospel is like a diamond with many facets. I&rsquo;m still somewhat reluctant to find a home in any one camp, for fear that it would flatten this diamond and completely obscure the other facets.</p>

<p><em>(Aside: I&rsquo;ve been having a very &ldquo;meta&rdquo; moment lately as I realize that I&rsquo;m starting to identify with the Reformed folks and immediately find myself resisting that association&mdash;then realizing it&rsquo;s only because I don&rsquo;t like the label. Categories&mdash;blast!)</em></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong&mdash;all this talk about &ldquo;camps&rdquo; and theological disagreement shouldn&rsquo;t divide the church (although sadly, it sometimes does). I&rsquo;d say we all share 80% of the same beliefs&mdash;Jesus, essentially&mdash;and the other 20% are cause for thought and research and prayer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really struggling with integration right now. I want to know Jesus in 3-D. I need that solid foundation to stand on. Jesus, I need a clear picture of you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned this year, it&rsquo;s that nearly everything escapes categorization. Everything I&rsquo;ve come across has failed to fit in my neat &amp; trim boxes. Far less things are solid black and solid white than I&rsquo;d like to admit. It&rsquo;s not that there are mixed shades of grey, but as I walk closer I find speckles of black and white.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been somewhat of a chameleon, making friends with all sides of every debate. These friends of mine, these high-minded philosophies and world-views from around the globe have been swapped around every once in awhile. I always thought of it as a way of achieving balance; never allowing myself to linger about in one place lest I become too &ldquo;closed-minded&rdquo; or let myself be &ldquo;blind&rdquo; to the possibilities of other perspectives. So I&rsquo;d put myself in my friends&#8217; shoes, then switch once, twice, and once again.</p>

<p><em>In the areas of: </em>politics &amp; Christology &amp; missiology &amp; hermeneutics &amp; <em>Truth?</em> &amp; messed up people <em>a.k.a. me</em> &amp; frenemies (haha) &amp; sin &amp; Grace &amp; redemption &amp; justice &amp; the Divine</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a whole lot of hopscotching in a whole lot of arenas. I&rsquo;m not taking a position on any of these things, because I see the value in every position. It&rsquo;s some twisted kind of dance. I&rsquo;m tired of it.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m being unintelligible to everybody but myself here (and even that&rsquo;s debatable). But essentially, I think this homelessness I&rsquo;m experiencing is a result of 1) reckless deconstruction 2) reading too wide and too shallow and 3) some personal, irrational aversion to forming convictions and using my voice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to elaborate on this more in later posts, but tonight I&rsquo;m trying to articulate a certain frustration.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>James 1:5-6 (NASB)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so a few of you know that I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy-maximizing_behaviors">hypermiling</a> (further explained in a <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/01/king_of_the_hypermilers.html">Mother Jones article</a>) for a few months now. Hypermiling is basically the art of driving in a way that you squeeze the maximum fuel economy out of your car.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m a bit of a mileage wonk. Particularly because I see fuel economy as some sort of a game (albeit with higher consequences). </em></p>

<p>On average I&rsquo;m able to get 310 miles out of a tank of gas in my 2002 4-cylinder Honda Accord (mixed driving on highway and city roads). That&rsquo;s 20.9 MPG. On bad months of pure city driving, I&rsquo;ll get maybe 280 miles on a tank (18.9 MPG). On a highway road trip, I&rsquo;ll push 360 miles a tank (24.3 MPG).</p>

<p>This past month I hypermiled on a tank of gas. I ended up with 394 miles on a tank (approximately 26.4 MPG). That&rsquo;s a 20% increase in mileage&mdash;not bad! I think of that as a 20% discount on a tank of gas.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a few driving tips from the hypermiling pros I&rsquo;ve adopted (whether they&rsquo;ll stick with me in the long-term, is another matter):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Slow, constant acceleration:</strong> Always gently depress the accelerator pedal coming from a standstill. There&rsquo;s no rush and there&rsquo;s no use in burning gas on rapid starts and stops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know your car&rsquo;s power curve:</strong> After a while you can figure out which speeds in which gear give your car the best speed/mileage ratio. I usually lock into the bottom end of third gear on city roads&mdash;at that point, I&rsquo;m barely feeding any gas and maintaining speed at 30MPH. On highways I ease off around 55-60MPH.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t use the brakes (kinda):</strong> Okay, this is admittedly one of my more dangerous habits. I attempt to brake as little as possible because braking is essentially throwing momentum (e.g. gas) away. So that means spacing myself away from the car in front so I can try to even out the jerk of start and stop traffic with a constant low velocity. That also means taking turns at higher speeds (don&rsquo;t try this with passengers).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hills are your friends</strong>: I shift into neutral coming down some longer hills and overpasses instead of gassing, letting momentum take me down hills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slower is better:</strong> When I&rsquo;m not in a hurry, I take the slow lane and dial it back to 50-60MPH. That&rsquo;s actually a pretty optimal speed for most cars and trucks. But to make up for this, you&rsquo;ll have to leave for your destination about 5-10 minutes earlier so you don&rsquo;t feel rushed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Draft&hellip; carefully</strong>: Drafting, a trick reserved for NASCAR drivers, usually means driving closely behind larger vehicles (usually trucks). You get better gas mileage because the truck has essentially carved out a channel in the air for your car, and there is less air resistance for your car to &ldquo;push&rdquo; against. Warning: This is technically tailgating and is probably ridiculously dangerous. I usually just try to pull up behind a big rig and follow it at a distance and hope for <em>some</em> sort of fuel-saving effect (I&rsquo;m not willing to play with my life though&hellip;)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swallow your pride:</strong> So other people think you drive like a sissy. You pull up to the gas pump and your wallet is your vindication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uh, but don&rsquo;t forget to drive safely</strong>: Recklessly taking turns at 40MPH or tailgating some dude by a matter of inches or driving so slow that you disrupt traffic flow are all dumb ideas. Don&rsquo;t do &lsquo;em. And before you try any of this stuff, can you sign my liability waiver?</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been home a week and I&rsquo;ve been thinking about America. (&ldquo;Home, and drinking the milk of prosperity,&rdquo; I joked with a few friends).</p>

<p>I think about how easily satiated I can be with <em>things</em>. No hard truths or intellectual finagling, please, just <em>Oprah</em> sensibilities. I&rsquo;ll suffer the drivel of a nine-to-five to get cash to lay down at the altar of Stuff. There&rsquo;s something in the air here that dulls our senses beyond <em>MTV</em> realities. It&rsquo;s a fleece that keeps us blind to our poverty: intellectual, moral and spiritual.</p>

<p>I could pick this up while in China, too: we&rsquo;d meet folks who&rsquo;d spend a good portion of their paycheck to upgrade to the flashiest cell phone and students with harebrained schemes to get an overseas education to guarantee success. It&rsquo;s somewhat ironic; not even an authoritarian government can stop the waves of <em>Materialism</em> at the gates.</p>

<p>The irony cuts both ways. Here I am, claiming to know the One who promised to be the &ldquo;Living Water&rdquo; satisfying <em>every</em> thirst, and just the other day I was out on <a href="http://www.dealnews.com">Dealnews</a> for hours <em>fantasizing</em> about assembling a new desktop computer. It wasn&rsquo;t the act itself that was Disgusting, it was the slimy feeling of not being able to Snap Out of It.</p>

<p>Essentially the setup is this: there is an infinitely beautiful, valuable Treasure whose worth is hidden in this world. If I believe <em>anything</em> else is worth more, I cheapen the Treasure.</p>

<p>Jesus talked about not serving &ldquo;God and money…you will hate one and love the other.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the exclusionary tilt that gives me pause; if I ever think that I can chase both with equal gusto, then to some degree I believe the myth that Stuff Will Satisfy. It&rsquo;s just that in America, two-hundred million folks have proven this wrong.</p>

<h4>So how do you cope?</h4>

<p>How do we live unfettered from the idolatry of stuff? How do we refocus on the Treasure? I&rsquo;m talking practically speaking, small steps, changes in attitude. Where do we start?</p>
