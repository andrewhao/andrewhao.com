  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m only starting to grasp what it&rsquo;s like post-graduation. I mean, I&rsquo;ve walked (in an intense, rainy, 3-and-a-half-hour ceremony). I&rsquo;ve said goodbyes to friends moving on. I&rsquo;ve moved apartments (goodbye, Royston, you&rsquo;ve been good to me). I&rsquo;ve started work at Apple, which is pretty sweet.</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m done. I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say. I feel like my undergraduate years are behind me. And yes, in spirit, they are. I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m working. (This is weird. I&rsquo;m done, but I&rsquo;m not&mdash;there&rsquo;s still that tiny matter of that last semester.)</p>

<p>I think I want to get out. And then I think I want to stay in academia, forever. I know I&rsquo;ll miss the friendships, late night hangouts, homework (seriously!), flex time in the day, and that general college freedom.</p>

<p>I joke about how weird super-senior year will be&mdash;almost like being a ghost, still hanging around but obviously not belonging. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing &lsquo;round these parts?&rdquo; people will ask me, to which I&rsquo;ll respond, &ldquo;oh nothin&rsquo;&hellip; just hanging around.&rdquo; Then I&rsquo;ll float on slowly back to my room. I&rsquo;ll start moving on, but not. I&rsquo;m half there and half here.</p>

<p>But before I can move forward, I want to stop and remember. I want to stop and be thankful for what God&rsquo;s done in my life this semester. I want to acknowledge the highs and lows and come back to the knowledge that these times are the best&mdash;and they only get better.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to spend the next couple of entries or so looking back and remembering and reminiscing and celebrating the good things. You might even catch a photo or two or twenty. Yes, life moves forward, but I&rsquo;m going to stay here a bit and catch my breath. Thanks for hanging in there with me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Man, I am so calloused.</p>

<p>These past few weeks have been sorrowful ones for humanity. Cyclones, earthquakes, bombings, and the like.</p>

<p>I am having a hard time <em>feeling</em>. My head knows these catastrophes are tragic and the need to move and seek help are dire and swift, but my heart has a hard time noticing.</p>

<p>Wake me up from American complacency. Bring me to my knees in prayer. Move my hands to help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I looked at my shoes today: brown loafers, a size too large on my feet. I was walking back from class, when I remembered my father and thought about his shoes. They are his; bought years ago but never worn. They are classy, with shiny brown patent leather, certainly the kind of shoes that would make a statement at any formal event.</p>

<p>My father doesn&rsquo;t wear these shoes. He wears another pair proudly, a pair of Bass loafers bought from an outlet store. He&rsquo;s worn them for seven years or so, always proudly showing them to us. &ldquo;See how long I&rsquo;ve worn them?&rdquo; he used to brag to us, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so comfortable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mind&rsquo;s eye takes me to his boyhood in Taiwan; he is playing in the grassy banks of the <em>Hsintien</em> river, dallying in the water, swimming in its clear, swift current. He has nothing to do all summer but eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_apple">water apples</a> and watermelon slices and run along the shores&#8217; silver banks.</p>

<p>He is from a poor family, but they are happy. At night they sit around the table and talk, smiling, laughing about the day&rsquo;s events. His brothers, sisters and he are all tanned, their hair shocked from the sun and heat.</p>

<p>Last year, my father told me to take these shiny loafers shoes up to school. &ldquo;You might need them for special occasions,&rdquo; he told me. They were a size too big, so I took the insoles off my running shoes and stuck them into these clunky shoes. Then they sat in my apartment by the doorway, waiting for the few special occasions that I did get to wear them: weddings, banquets and formals.</p>

<p>As a child, my father wears his shoes until the soles wear out. These shoes have lay upon the riverbanks for countless summer hours&mdash;patiently watching as my father, a playful boy, swims in the waters. They cannot afford to buy more shoes, but he doesn&rsquo;t mind. To him, they are just as comfortable as the day he received them.</p>

<p>And still, my father wears his shoes until the soles run out. It never crosses his mind to buy a new pair. Despite the insistence of my mother to get him a new pair, he stubbornly wears the same ones. To work, on vacations, in airplanes, on nature hikes, on the tennis court and along sun-soaked riverbanks.</p>

<p>I am walking back from class, wearing shiny shoes that my father hasn&rsquo;t worn&mdash;yet&mdash;when I think about him.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Christians believe in a spiritual dimension to everyday life. It&rsquo;s mostly invisible and occasionally tangible. It&rsquo;s described in Scripture as a war between God and Anti-God, where humanity is caught in between the warring sides.</p>

<p>On that note, Satan sucks.</p>

<p>Everybody&rsquo;s catching flak. There&rsquo;s been a lot of suffering, and a lot of loss. I&rsquo;ve felt a lot of despair, and I&rsquo;m not alone. There are relationships being torn apart. There&rsquo;s weariness, resurfacing addictions, brokenness&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also mentioned in Scripture that <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:10-18;&amp;version=31;">the Divine has all authority over Anti-God</a>, and in the end, it trumps all. It is Good, it is overwhelmingly beautiful, it promises a superior pleasure and joy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://blog.andrewhao.com/2007/11/27/on-manhood-mission/">briefly mentioned</a> this, these are the times to <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Articles/ByDate/1995/1539_How_Shall_We_Fight_for_Joy/">fight for joy</a>. These are the times to pray hard with many tears. These are the times to cling on to the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%205:5;&amp;version=31;">hope that does not disappoint</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I&rsquo;ve been moving in-to &amp; in-between identities lately</em>.</p>

<p>As a boyfriend, I&rsquo;m newly challenged by the call to care for and serve somebody. And I know I haven&rsquo;t written much about Sarah and my relationship, but I&rsquo;ll say that every day I learn a little bit more about how God loves. I&rsquo;m reminded what a good gift she is to me. I think I want to describe how things have changed since and what we&rsquo;re looking at now.</p>

<p>As a single guy, I could spend my time wherever and whenever I wanted it. I had freedom. I could think about my future for myself and have a reasonable trajectory to achieve whatever goals I had. Honestly speaking, I had more freedom with respect to my time and my plans.</p>

<p>As a dating guy, life is a bit busier. I spend a lot more time with Sarah. I&rsquo;m listening a lot more, processing things with her, and she does the same with me. We&rsquo;re starting to think about the future, but negotiating how to walk through it together.</p>

<p>This process of thinking forward, <em>together</em>, is a good process, albeit new to us. It&rsquo;s partially fueled by the inexorable tide of graduation and post-college scariness, and partially by the desire to be with each other. There are challenges to that, particularly as we don&rsquo;t know how our passions and dreams will intersect in the future. I want to have it all marked down and planned out; I want to solve for all the variables before plunging into a commitment. It&rsquo;s hard to plan for the future without knowing how far you should look ahead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m learning that this dating thing is so. much. about. trust. It&rsquo;s so much about trusting in the other to look out for your best, but much, much, more about us both trusting that Jesus knows where he&rsquo;s taking us.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful dimension to this process, and you can find it in the commitment. I think that&rsquo;s the Gospel key that Christian relationships should be characterized by: making a commitment to the other (even when the variables aren&rsquo;t in place), dying to self, looking out for the best of the other, and following hard after Jesus together. I&rsquo;m slowly, slowly learning.</p>

<p>In the end, we&rsquo;re clinging onto Jesus and praying that he&rsquo;s gonna tell us where to go. I don&rsquo;t completely understand what that means, and a part of me writes it off as naivete.</p>

<p>So much of this is new and scary to me, but another part of it has been there all along, you know? It comes back to the Gospel and how Jesus did it first&mdash;we get to model it out now.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all worth it. It&rsquo;s totally worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friend Lily and I have been talking of running a half-marathon since December. We signed up for the <a href="http://www.firstwave-events.com/sc_half/">Santa Cruz Half-Marathon</a> a couple of months ago along with a couple of friends.</p>

<p>Training was pretty flexible: we mostly ran on our own and starting in March got together on the weekends to run a longer-distance course.  We did quite a few different routes in Berkeley: Rockridge BART, Indian Rock, the (full) Fire Trail, the Berkeley Marina, and so on. I must say it was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>We had a couple of friends drop out of the race because of schedule conflicts (sorry Ziwei, Jared) but in the end it was myself, Lily and Josiah that could make it on race day. We were accompanied by our friends Hannah and Jen who to hung out with us and cheered us on.</p>

<p>Friday night after Large Group we drove back to my house in Saratoga and stayed the night, then at the crack of dawn at 5AM, we drove into Santa Cruz. After getting our race numbers and timing chips, we headed to the starting line.</p>

<p>Josiah took off from the start and zoomed off to a 2nd place finish in his age group (and garnering a 9-minute PR in the process). Lily finished with a 5th place finish in her age group. I am running with beasts.</p>

<p>Wow, what an amazing run. The half-marathon starts on the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk and takes you by the ocean, cliffs, surf, sunshine and all. It was a warm day, so the 7AM was already pretty balmy. Perfect conditions, I tell you.</p>

<p>And I had a blast; I felt really good through nearly the entire run. Towards the end I could feel the strain on my knees, but that&rsquo;ll solve itself in a week or so. Which already has me thinking of another race: anybody want to run a full marathon?</p>

<p>We all hung out at the beach &amp; boardwalk afterwards, with nothing to do but rest and shoot the breeze. The sand &amp; surf were amazing. What a feeling. I can&rsquo;t get over it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>April is a crazy month. Last week I spent thirty hours slaving over a <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/sp08/hw/proj2-notes.html">semantic analyzer</a> for my <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/sp08/">compilers class</a>. We didn&rsquo;t exactly get it working perfectly, but it&rsquo;s good enough.  But I&rsquo;m also reminded how I will not miss these late nights in Soda Hall. Okay, maybe a little.</p>

<p>I totally enjoyed our Freshmen Retreat Off Campus, a little shindig the staff and senior class here at <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ccf">Intervarsity</a> put on for the freshmen class. We invited a group of freshmen in our fellowship out to Oakland for a weekend of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2011;&amp;version=47;">Acts</a> manuscript study and hangout time with our class. I led a seminar that went over the sexual struggles of Christian men and gave some principles to fight the battle with (we titled it &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/band-of-brothers-men-and-sexuality.pdf">Band of Brothers: The Man Seminar</a>&rdquo; or succinctly, &ldquo;The Man-inar&rdquo;). It was rather healing; telling my story and finding rapport and even grace with other bros. Other fellow seniors led seminars ranging from time management to campus engagement to relationships to spiritual disciplines.</p>

<p>All in all, we definitely had a blast this week. We&rsquo;re glad the frosh enjoyed the weekend, and we definitely see tons of potential in their community.</p>

<p>Now that much of the craziness is over (just for now), I promise to start writing more. There&rsquo;s a lot I have to tell you about. If you haven&rsquo;t discovered it yet, I keep short updates of my life over on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/andrewhao">my Twitter feed</a>. Think of it as a place where I just tell you inane details of my life (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m eating a cheeseburger!&rdquo;, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe my professor just called us twits!&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I also really, really, really miss design. I&rsquo;ve got a few pieces I can&rsquo;t wait to show you all. And I have tons of photos to update. Egads, this is going to be fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This semester I&rsquo;m taking IEOR 190A &ndash; Engineering Entrepreneurship. We are made up of a bunch of business types and engineering types and business-engineering types who come together to figure out how to start a business in the tech sphere.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d explain this class: come up with a business plan for a company in semester, then execute it. At the end of the semester, you should have the tools to <em>actually do it</em>. Yow!</p>

<p>The thought of (or idea of) entrepreneurship is really alluring. I think it&rsquo;s the <em>idea of creating</em> something where there was nothing, starting and sustaining a great idea or product that could change the world (or something slightly less schnazzy, sure) seems so rewarding.</p>

<p>Of course,  in class we only hear from the smiling guest lecturers who navigated shaky start-ups through uncertain waters and nailed crucial business decisions to accelerate earnings by 1000% margins. We always hear about the mythical serial entrepreneur, the quintessential American man or woman who by a mix of cunning insight, dogged perseverance and arbitrary market whims (e.g. sheer luck), see their dreams become reality.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t always hear from the entrepreneur whose family life is strained because he always travels or stays late in the office. We don&rsquo;t always hear from the men and women who burn through money on dud after dud.</p>

<p>I worked with my friend Dave at FAQLY, his social networking startup two years ago my sophomore year. Dave was way passionate about the network and its potential. I knew it took a toll on him. Most of his waking hours were spent dreaming (I like to think) of ideas. He didn&rsquo;t sleep much.  He had to play many roles, from visionary to manager to chauffeur (haha, hi Dave!).</p>

<p>Anyways, my point was that even though there was a high potential for failure and a <em>ridiculously</em> demanding workload, Dave persevered through it all. Two years later, Dave&rsquo;s working on another project now (have you heard of <a href="http://www.thinkgos.com">gOS</a>?). And I talk to him occasionally and he tells me that he&rsquo;s still not sleeping much. I know he&rsquo;s just as passionate.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to suspect that the draw to start a company is less about the idea than it is about the <em>feeling</em> of creating. It&rsquo;s elusive and fleeting but when you catch it, you&rsquo;re energized to try some more.</p>

<p>Hsiu-Fan and I are still a bit hesitant to call <a href="http://wejoinin.com">Wejoinin</a> anything more than a pet project. Could it be anything more? Who knows. We&rsquo;re treading carefully on that idea as we carefully calibrate our expectations. It&rsquo;s been kind of cool as I start applying what I learn from IEOR 190A to Wejoinin.</p>

<p>One thing&rsquo;s for sure, though. I&rsquo;m in it for love of the game. I&rsquo;m there because I feel alive when I create. Whether that means I&rsquo;m behind the terminal or on the field or whatever remains to be seen.</p>
