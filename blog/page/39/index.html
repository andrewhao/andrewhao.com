  <div class="entry-content"><p>And so it begins!</p>

<p>Friends, I&rsquo;m sick sick sick sick sick. Not miserably so, but just enough to make me wonder how I&rsquo;m going to get through this week chock-full with enough projects and papers to fill the metaphorical sink.</p>

<p>I told myself that this semester would be different. Health over academics. God (-seeking, -savoring) over ministry (funny how I see them as exclusive&hellip; hm). I&rsquo;m trying to pull out of the fast lane. I&rsquo;m in some sort of transition period, but it strangely doesn&rsquo;t feel as such.</p>

<p>By grace alone that gives me another breath,<br/>
-Andrew</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mike is a man growing familiar with death. It passes him on the street, he sees it in the faces of passerbys. Nightly he greets its spectre on Durant Avenue.  Tonight, as every night, heï¿½s shaking the cup in front of the Asian Ghetto food court.</p>

<p>He usually does most of the talking.  ï¿½Drew, they ticketed me last night for sitting on these milk crates. Officer came right up and says, ï¿½You know you canï¿½t be sitting there.ï¿½ I say, ï¿½Oh yeah, why?ï¿½ and he shows me the side of the crate.ï¿½ Mike lifts a nearby crate and holds it against the light of the street lamp to make out the message, SITTING ON CRATES IS A PUNISHABLE OFFENSE. Mike chuckles, sets the crate down and shoots me a grin, ï¿½Ainï¿½t that a trip, ainï¿½t that a trip?ï¿½</p>

<p>He is a tall African-American man, in nylon warmups and a shirt a few sizes too big. His salt-and-pepper beard is thick and coarse, and every few minutes he brings his hands out of his pockets to rub his palms against his bald head.</p>

<p>Mike always does the talking. ï¿½So I was on Durant the other night and I meet this guy I met on the streets, his name is Jack.ï¿½ Rocking back and forth, he continues. ï¿½Jack shows me this check he gotï¿½eighty-four hundred dollars, eighty-four hundred dollars he got it off of disability. Took it to Oakland and blew four thousand on a motel and a woman.ï¿½ He gives me a disbelieving look. ï¿½Ainï¿½t that a trip?ï¿½</p>

<p>He is silent for a second as a glazed look passes over his eyes. He strikes his chest a few times. ï¿½It hits me like a rock sometimes,ï¿½ he tells me slowly. His heart is giving out on him. ï¿½Now my hands are doing it again.ï¿½ His hands are starting to ache, a result of a history of heart problems and tremors that resurface in the lull between the times when he takes his heart pills.</p>

<p>Mike is shuffling back and forth, on and off the curb as he continues his monologue, dancing, jumping on and off the curb, backing dangerously close to Durantï¿½s nighttime traffic. ï¿½God bless me,ï¿½ he tells me, ï¿½God bless me.ï¿½</p>

<p>He furtively pulls out a cigarette, lights it and takes a deep, hard drag. ï¿½I havenï¿½t had one all day. Just had to.ï¿½ The butt of the cigarette shines bright against the darkness of the night. He coughs a few times and holds his chest. ï¿½Here it comes again, here it comes.ï¿½ Throwing his cigarette on the ground, he gives it a few good stomps until it is ashes on concrete.</p>

<p>ï¿½Iï¿½m aight, Iï¿½m aightï¿½ he tells me.
ï¿½Are you sure?ï¿½
ï¿½Yeah.ï¿½
ï¿½Mike, is it bad?ï¿½</p>

<p>He moves to his leather bag, full of scrawled phone numbers on paper scraps and his heart pills. He is fumbling with the zipper of the side pocket; heï¿½s trying to feel around the teeth for the pull handle but his shaking hands give him a hard time.  Finally succeeding, he grabs the bottle of nitroglycerine and pours out the pills into the palm of his hands. I am surprised; the nitro pills are much smaller than I had imagined, about the size of a Tic-Tac.</p>

<p>Mike puts a pill on his tongue and gives me a face. ï¿½The nitro pills give me a headache. Last time I was at the hospital they pumped it straight into my chest.ï¿½ He gesticulates wildly. ï¿½Went straight to my head. Like a headache in your sleep. I ripped the nodes off my chest the next morning but the EKG went off. They came right back in and put them right back on.ï¿½</p>

<p>A few minutes pass, and he finally stands up to his full height. ï¿½The headacheï¿½s gone. Thank God that nitro works.ï¿½ A man with wavy brown hair passes us and calls out to Mikeï¿½he obviously knows him. ï¿½Hey man, Iï¿½ll give you fifty cents for two cigs.ï¿½ Mike pulls out his pack and pulls out two, then three, then he holds out the entire pack to the man. ï¿½Here, you go ahead and have the whole thing.ï¿½ The man holds up his hands, ï¿½I canï¿½t, Iï¿½ve only got fifty cents. And I was only gonna smoke two before I went to sleep.ï¿½ Mike insists, holding out the pack of Kools but the man only takes two and drops some change into Mikeï¿½s cup. Mike laughs. ï¿½What a trip. And I was only doing myself a favor.ï¿½</p>

<p>A few minutes pass, and he finally stands up to his full height. ï¿½Andrew, I had a hard life. I canï¿½t count my blessings on one hand.ï¿½ He is swaying now, one foot on the curb then hopping off, teetering far too close to the edge of traffic. Mike knows his time is coming. ï¿½God bless me.ï¿½ He shakes his head, ï¿½God bless me.ï¿½</p>

<p>A note: Mike has been a familiar face in Berkeley for the past half year or so, and I decided I would start documenting my encounters and experiences with him. Why? I&rsquo;m not quite sure myself. But I&rsquo;ll keep writing, and we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was a big reminder of how good God is.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Waking up slow (a la Jack Johnson&rsquo;s Banana Pancakes)&hellip; to the sound of roaring machinery in the big Underhill ditch.</p></li>
<li><p>Up, but still waking upï¿½walking to the living room and sitting on the new couch (big ups to Charles for snagging it for us).</p></li>
<li>Wandering campus: praying, walking, journaling, taking photos, seeing old faces.</li>
<li>Thank you, Lisa for a good meal and good company.</li>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling at the stories being shared at Tim Lowe&rsquo;s goodbye party. You have to meet the man to appreciate this, but each story shared was a testament to the strength and faith and humility and sincerity and hilarity of this man and the God who raised him up. I seriously could not stop smiling, and all I could think was thankyouthankyouthankyou for friends like Tim. You could feel the love in the room, heck, you could scrape it off the walls and collect it in buckets.</li>
<li><p>Unexpectedly being prayed for. Kind of like mugging. The best kind.</p></li>
<li><p>Meeting with accountability. Thank you God. I know You love me through Jeremy.</p></li>
<li>Late-night sugary surprises, a 20th birthday for Eric, hanging around the College apartments catching up with friends, the warm drone of conversation echoing in my head, comfort food tumbling in my stomach.
Mmm, yeah. Lazy Monday, baby.</li>
</ul>


<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;EDIT<br/>
Has anybody seen the new <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130#comments">changes</a>? Do you like them or do you (as many, nay, most have reported) not? Two design/UI issues stand out from my brief observation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Information overload: The new layout displays far too much information than the skinny layout was intended to carry. Facebook UI designers are going to have to up the width of the layout (and consider the myriad of design implications that come with it).</p></li>
<li><p> Stalkers, rejoice: The new mini-feeds feature displays all your user activityï¿½whether you want it to or not. Is there any way to keep the minifeed from displaying on your profile? A quick review of the privacy options shows there isn&rsquo;t. This is somewhat a violation of trust between a user and Facebook. My prediction? Overwhelming user feedback will cause the FB team to by default, disable the mini-feed module and allow users to turn it on at their discretion. Additional privacy options will be implemented to allow or disallow the broadcast of your various activities to your friends.
These are all design challenges that we at FAQQLY faced this summer and, trust me, I have great sympathy for FB&rsquo;s team undergoing headaches caused by the redesign (it is unfortunate that the few mistakes they have made overshadow the positive design changes they have implemented). It seems the development team skipped a few steps in the design cycleï¿½they tried to attack the problem from a different perspective than the end-users&#8217;ï¿½&#8221;let&rsquo;s make Facebook a place to stay abreast of your social relationships&#8221; vs. &ldquo;I want to have control over my profile, here and now.&rdquo; Only they have about 5000x more users. And about that much more money. And maybe 10x more developers.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Plaudits for a commendable job with functionality extension, now how about bringing us design with end users in mind?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;EDIT2<br/>
Mike Arrington of TechCrunch <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/05/new-facebook-redesign-more-than-just-aesthetics/">weighs in</a> with a suprisingly positive review, giving props to FB&rsquo;s &ldquo;attention metastream.&#8221;<br/>
Pete Cashmore of Mashable! <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/09/05/facebooks-facelift-mini-feeds-and-news-feeds/">comments</a>: &rdquo;<strong>These additions might seem fairly small, but they could have a major effect on how users interact with the site.&ldquo;</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do any fellow geeks out there follow any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_things_done">GettingThingsDone</a> (GTD) practices?</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m trying to get my life organizedï¿½a futile attempt before the sledgehammer of school and responsibilities drops. Organized as in&hellip; prioritizing, managing time, et cetera.) A couple things I&rsquo;ve done:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://entropicprincipal.blogspot.com/2005/09/using-thunderbird-to-get-things-done.html">GTD-ized my Thunderbird client</a> (heck, I never knew labels could be so useful) and it seems to really help keep my mind on track when I field emails (I receive twenty to forty non-spam messages a day). The basic principle is to tag (label) your mail the instant it shows up in your inbox with its priority status. Then you run back through your mail and attack each piece according to its priority.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m syncing my Palm V to Yahoo Calendar. Using the Yahoo Widgets Day Planner widget as an interface, I&rsquo;m basically able to access my calendar information anywhere, whether I have the Palm or not. I&rsquo;m still debating whether this is useful because the sync is less-than-accurate and well, nothing beats pencil and paper (a la the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda/">Hipster PDA</a>. Has anybody used it? What were your experiences?)
Sorry, that was a quick break from our regularly scheduled programming. Geek, out.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This first week&rsquo;s been quite different. I have free time and I honestly don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p>

<p>My apartment&rsquo;s rearranged now (you may have remembered it was in the 3-and-3 arrangement, Communist-style). We&rsquo;ve rearranged so Mike gets a single and Charles and I share a double room. And once again, my bed is in the same room as my computer (far in the future, Andrew will likely take numerous napsï¿½all unintentionalï¿½while writing a paper of some sorts).</p>

<p>I really do like my classes this semester (thus far). I really enjoy the smaller scope and greater depth that upper-divs offer (I&rsquo;m waiting for lightning to strike me as I type this statement). I&rsquo;m taking an operating systems course, a human-computer interaction (HCI) course, a sociological methods course and a mass communications theory survey course.</p>

<p>But once again, it&rsquo;s weird (especially this first week). I don&rsquo;t have class until 11 or 12, nor any classes on Fridays and I have no homework to fill that space (oh, it will come soon). I&rsquo;m sitting in the library trying to read ahead for all my courses and, well, beyond that I don&rsquo;t know what else I can do. I guess the workaholic in me dies hard, real hard.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been cool though cuz I&rsquo;ve really gotten to spend some quality time with the King lately. It&rsquo;s been a slow transformation starting from the beginning of this summer, but in short, so many things are so much more real. From relationships to scriptural understanding to prayerï¿½it&rsquo;s been so exciting. And so many issues that I&rsquo;ve struggled with last yearï¿½from feeling I was being too legalistic or being too permissive, dealing with insecurities in calling out my brothers, my lack of courage in sharing the Gospel, my latent disappointment and cynicism with the churchï¿½have not been fully resolved, but instead what&rsquo;s been most comforting is the image of the Cross that even now is burning its way to the forefront of my mind. And the realization that I never fully grasped the height and width and crazy depths of love that a Father gave. And the more that is being revealed to me, the more I can trust.</p>

<p>(Sorry, that came out kind of rushed and jumbled. I&rsquo;m trying to process by writing.)</p>

<p>In any case, life has been slower than usual, and it feels right.</p>

<p>(Unrelated: Hey sneak heads, that Fresh Kicks store off the corner of Bowditch and Durant is having a clearance sale (but they&rsquo;re not advertising it, at least not now). All shoes are 40% to 70% off &ndash; that&rsquo;s pretty nuts. I got a pair of <a href="http://www.royalelastics.com/">Royal Elastics</a> for about twenty dollars, ain&rsquo;t that sweet?)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m such a workaholic. On my Sabbath, I did some work in the FAQQLY codebase. Theoretically, my internship finished last week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Eccf/events/welcome-week-06">New Student Reception</a> was off the hook. &lsquo;Twas good seeing good and old faces. It was just draining, in every sense of the word. I gotta get away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When your castle of gilded cards falls down and your fraudulent
kingdom has burnt to ashes, when skeletons in your darkened nooks lie bare
naked in the everglow of a steady Lightï¿½thatï¿½s when you breathe, my friend. Thatï¿½s
when you know you walk the earth with Kings and thieves alike.  You have started over with the lowest of the low,
naked as the day you were born. O the heights from which youï¿½ve fallen!</p>

<p><em>I am full of earth and
dirt</em></p>

<p>And your Father is running to you. Do you see? Off in the
distance, heï¿½s running like mad. You canï¿½t see it now past paparazzi camera
flashes; you canï¿½t hear it now over the din of cruel laughter. You canï¿½t feel
it over your shame and disappointment and grief. But here he surely comes
running, wrapping his arms tight around your soiled clothes and whispers in
your ear <em>Son, you are still My son</em>.</p>

<p>Thatï¿½s when you can discard the troubles of the upkeep of a
fading faï¿½ade and you breathe, knowing  simply
that you, broken, humiliated and unworthy have nothing to boast in except in your
Father. Breathe in deeply &amp; sweetly, for the stale air has been knocked out
of your lungs. Take your first hesitant step into the warmth of the Light and press
on.</p>

<p>(Of course, by ï¿½youï¿½, I mean ï¿½meï¿½)</p>

<p><em>But a certain sign of
grace is this: from the broken earth, flowers come pushing through the dirt.</em></p>

<p><em>This is the verdict:
Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because
their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the
light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be
exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the
light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done
through God. (John 3:19-21)</em></p>
