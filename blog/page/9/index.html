  <div class="entry-content"><p>I dreamt the other night that I was running at midnight along the shore, no, there were cliffs, and we were running along the cliffs that wrap around the coast. The weather is warm, no, it has an icy bite, but we run anyways, out and around the shore, through silhouetted tree branches that bend in the breeze. Or perhaps they were shadows cast by city lights behind us. I can&rsquo;t quite recall.</p>

<p>I am running with someone, but I can&rsquo;t make out his or her form. I have my doubts though &mdash; was I running with you? I was running with <em>someone &mdash;</em></p>

<p>&mdash; we run into the surf and laugh (or gasp, I think they are the same) at its violent warmth. In a few weeks I&rsquo;ll dream in greys again and wake up smiling, no, puzzled.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Being around white people (and one Kenneth Leung) is making me more direct. There. I said it.</p>

<p>And I really love it! One thing I&rsquo;ve learned about myself is that I don&rsquo;t always know how to be genuine; that I can often say one thing but inside something else is going on. This often has to do with expressing negative emotions.</p>

<p>I admire people who can speak what&rsquo;s on their minds. Man, there&rsquo;s quite a freedom about that that I&rsquo;d like to have in my communication. No, I&rsquo;m not hating on being indirect (and Asian-Am, to some extent), but I just want to learn to say what&rsquo;s on my mind. Dude. It&rsquo;s weird. It&rsquo;s freeing. All of the following I&rsquo;ve had real problems expressing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it when <em>(annoying thing happens).</em>&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;I have problems with <em>(person&rsquo;s name)</em>.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t do that for you.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;I wish <em>(this person)</em> would stop <em>(behavior</em>).&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And most importantly&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>This has the potential to blow open the realms of communicative possibilities. Er&hellip; I hope this doesn&rsquo;t get me in trouble.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mentioned earlier that I get pretty mad when people litter in the parking lot. For example, this showed up one morning a few days after we swept the entire lot:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1241&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Nooooooo&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2010/10/01/on-litter/photo-oct-01-2-56-50-pm/"><img src="http://www.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Photo-Oct-01-2-56-50-PM-500x375.jpg" alt="" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty easy to have a bad attitude about it when you&rsquo;re the one who has to clean up after them. And it&rsquo;s even worse when it feels like nobody in Oakland takes pride in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>But today I caught a glimpse of one of our neighbors sweeping our sidewalk on 3rd st. without asking. He crossed the street to pick up the paper plates, Coke bottles and cigarette butts that litter our side of the block.</p>

<p>That inspired me a lot and got me thinking. I wanna serve out of joy in keeping the neighborhood tidy. I&rsquo;m glad to know that there are folks out there who take pride in how the community looks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel pretty comfortable walking around shirtless. Sunday at 3pm before service I walked into the chapel sans shirt to find Albert there doing couples&#8217; counseling. Guy: hey, he&rsquo;s shirtless. Albert: yeah (silence)&hellip; he&rsquo;s an intern. I blame this all on Dave, who is shirtless over half of the time.</p>

<p>My diet consists two parts peanut butter jelly sandwich, one part spaghetti and one part whatever the heck we find lying around. It&rsquo;s just carbs and sugar&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve eaten vegetables in a week. Except after service when we had the party platter of hummus.</p>

<p>I get pretty mad when people leave litter in the parking lot. This isn&rsquo;t just like a wrapper here and there, but it&rsquo;s like entire boxes of empty Capri Suns. There is definitely a culture of littering here.</p>

<p>Stephen Ministry is the best thing ever. I mean yeah this whole &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; bit is terrifying, but on the bright side, one of our classmates is an eighty year old grandma who makes excellent brownies. And she can see into our souls. Nice.</p>

<p>I have an IT band injury so I can&rsquo;t go running for who knows how long and it&rsquo;s pretty frustrating.</p>

<p>Sometimes I visit cities other than Oakland and remember what clean looks like.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what just dropped. Long ago I lost any qualms about picking it up with bare hands.</p>

<p>I really enjoy being in this community. I am reminded that life is short, Jesus is Good, laughter is contagious, and shirts are always optional.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Man, God is totally wrecking me with this Betty thing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been hard not to be cold to Betty after our repeated confrontations with her. To not let bitterness take root every time I feel like I see her act out of (what I believe to be) entitlement. And well, if I had to call it out, it <em>is</em> entitlement.</p>

<p>Monique is another lady that sleeps on the porch steps of the main church building. She urinates on herself, which leaves a  lingering stench on the porch for days. I&rsquo;m not sure if the incontinence has psychological or physiological roots, but she has refused to let us take her to a medical facility or shelter and asked us to leave her alone.</p>

<p>I realize more now that you think you can help the homeless, but in reality you don&rsquo;t know how. And because they keep pushing your boundaries, asking for more food, taking away at your time, you start to build resentment toward them, and dehumanizing them in your mind, which leads to bitterness.</p>

<p>We asked Monique to leave. <em>But the church is the house of prayer</em>, she told us. We told her that we just didn&rsquo;t know how to help her, and that she just couldn&rsquo;t sleep on the steps. <em>Why can&rsquo;t you just leave me alone and let me sleep there?</em> she asked. Good question. We could, theoretically, but it&rsquo;s a health risk, we told her. We have people come in and out of that building all the time and it&rsquo;s unacceptable that they have to smell it. <em>Fine, I&rsquo;m done with you all, nyah,</em> she protested and she gathered her belongings and stormed off.</p>

<p>I felt pretty guilty, because while you know that you can&rsquo;t help her, the other part of you feels like it should. And the other part of you knows that you&rsquo;re making her feel bad, that she can&rsquo;t help her incontinence, that she probably feels totally condemned and ashamed right now, and you should just leave her be.</p>

<p>Betty got into a shouting match with Rico, another homeless man in our building today while we were fixing them dinner. The two exchanged volleys and Betty demanded to call the policy while Rico asked her to leave. &ldquo;I need some safety, some protection&rdquo; she kept saying while Rico yelled profanities at her. We asked Rico to leave, and Betty was adamant about calling the cops because she felt threatened. So she did. And we sat around and felt like fools waiting for the cops to arrive. This is stupid, we told ourselves. We&rsquo;re being held hostage in our own place.</p>

<p>I saw Monique get up from sleeping in the parking lot this morning. She averted her eyes and wouldn&rsquo;t talk to me and made gestures to get up and leave, then moments later when my head was turned she put her bags back down. <em>We need this lot cleared today</em> I told her. When she wouldn&rsquo;t answer, I held my gaze longer until she averted her eyes, then turn around and walk away. Why do I do this? I&rsquo;m not sure. It sure is easier to do than offering her to use the restroom and cleaning up after her. It might have to do with my cognitive dissonance and fear in asking her to leave the day before then not wanting to enforce that boundary the next morning. And it could be that I enjoy feeling powerful. This is really hard.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what God&rsquo;s doing in me through all this, but whatever it is, it&rsquo;s a lot more than I expected. Lord have mercy.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Edit: it&rsquo;s not all bad. I had a push-up pop afterwards and felt <em>much</em> better. I&rsquo;m not sure if Eric can say the same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s only week 2, but I already have my list.</p>

<h4>**You shouldn&rsquo;t be a Regen intern:</h4>

<p>**</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Guaranteed conflicts with people.</p></li>
<li><p>Janitorial work involving urine, mildew, and mold.</p></li>
<li><p>Always being available can take its toll on you.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone always eats your food in the fridge.</p></li>
<li><p>Boundary-setting is uncomfortable.</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday chores are long and hard.</p></li>
<li><p>There&rsquo;s a stray cat we can&rsquo;t get out of the basement showers.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>**You should be a Regen intern:</h4>

<p>**</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Living and serving with bros, within the Oakland community.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning how limited you are and how twisted your intentions truly are&hellip; and how those things are redeemed by Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p>Circuit training and taco truck Tuesdays. In-n-Out runs too.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing hard things is the only way to grow. For me, that&rsquo;s learning to set boundaries and being &ldquo;the bad guy&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>Tim Keller sermons.</p></li>
<li><p>Loving the local church. Its people are quirky, a little strange, yet amazing.</p></li>
<li><p>Eating someone else&rsquo;s food in the fridge.</p></li>
<li><p>Weeping at how merciful, gracious and Good our God is.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Betty is a homeless lady who has a bit more of a comfortable relationship with us. So oftentimes in the mornings she&rsquo;ll be fixing some breakfast for herself in the shared kitchen space that we have. Unfortunately, we&rsquo;ve been noticing some food going missing lately and suspiciously show up in hers.</p>

<p>I saw her in there one afternoon with the other interns and I basically asked her in a really indirect, passive-aggressive way whether she was taking our food. Betty became super defensive and left. After a few more moments of registering what just happened, I walked outside and apologized to her for basically accusing her of something in which I had no proof.</p>

<p>I realized two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I&rsquo;m terrible with confrontation, and I&rsquo;ve got to learn to be more direct.</p></li>
<li><p> It&rsquo;s just food, for crying out loud. I am far less noble than I think.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>And I have one question: how do you draw the line with your own boundaries and the needy in the world? How do you integrate God&rsquo;s kingdom and its infinite resources with the obvious limitations of yourself?</p>
