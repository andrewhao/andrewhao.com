  <div class="entry-content"><p>It startled me because I actually felt it last night, the groaning of a city. Carlos&#8217; voice expressed it best, a wail that shook the walls: <em>Oh / how he loves us oh / how he loves us </em>and I felt like crying.</p>

<p>Tonight it was there again as we ran with the street kids. <em>Rugby boys</em>, they call them, the dirt-caked homeless kids of the city who sniff Rugby-brand glue to forget the pangs of hunger in their bellies. One of the boys has taken a liking to me and has a habit of flying at me and landing square on my back. He perches on the shoulders of another boy and launches up, up, and away&hellip;</p>

<p>I want to wail, but I can&rsquo;t be heard over the singing of men and women prophesying over the boys in Cebuano: <em>Your Father loves you; your Father has prepared a house for you where there will be no more pain</em>. <em>Hear the voice of your Father&hellip;</em> The boys are lying on the ground, resting, wrestling, festering, sweltering. They sing, too, poking each other in between refrains.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this somewhere before. A dream? A crowded traffic circle, bright casino lights, the yellow cast of a sodium streetlamp, the sweltering heat. Twenty street kids, homeless men and women, an even-larger family surrounding them, and the songs. A song, their hearts, the traffic circle, the heart of the city, the children, the heart of the Father, their songs for the Father. They sing, I weep. I&rsquo;ve had this dream once before. Do the kids dream?</p>

<p>The congregation that we are with is also praying and listening. They are bent over next to each child as they whisper into their ears. A man not much younger than I translates for me: <em>he said thank you God for healing my brother</em>, or <em>that guy said thank you God for being with me another day</em>. I look over and Eric is cradling a girl who has fallen asleep in his arms. Zach is engrossed in a conversation with an old man. Ken carries a boy on his shoulders. We serve rice and pork stew slowly. I wield my ladle with slow, measured strokes in the broth. As it disappears I panic and pray harder.</p>

<p>What is this, Jesus? Something snaps and I want to cry; it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve felt this close to the Father. A dream buried from years ago resurfaces and wrecks me tonight. The city groans where the children sleep. I strain to listen; listen, can you hear? They are being birthed. Nobody wants to hold these children. Who will name them&mdash;the boy lands on my back and knocks the wind out of me&mdash;when we leave? Hurry, the children are arriving. Come and listen to their groans. The Father is close, and he has prepared them a home in his city.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/5670058698/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5670058698_18165aaff4.jpg" alt="Pasil view" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday we walked the slum village on the outskirts of town: Pasil. It was overwhelming: the crowded alleys bursting at the seams with noise, garbage, teeming life. The men are giving us resentful looks, sending us hostile messages with their eyes. The women are calling out to us&mdash;one grabs Zach&rsquo;s hand and walks with him hand-in-hand for a few steps. He recoils and she laughs, walking away with glimmering eyes.</p>

<p>Dave tells us to keep our eyes peeled down the alleys. I try to with sidelong glances, but it&rsquo;s hard to do so without appearing conspicuous. But I do and note that the dark side alleys run deep, giving testament to the sheer density and scope of this city within a city.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m intensely self-conscious. It&rsquo;s overwhelming; street kids hanging onto our pockets (we&rsquo;ve filled them with candy, and I find that my pocket has been sliced open already). They&rsquo;re everywhere, smothering me with their hands, fighting each other for the sweets. They&rsquo;re loud, intense, joyful, clamorous, direct (&ldquo;hey! give me money!&rdquo;). God, do I have a category for this?</p>

<p>I find myself walking through the alleys with a steely gaze, a half-smile plastered on my face. I&rsquo;ve experienced parts of this before, somewhere, but never all at once. I wonder how I&rsquo;m perceived. A Western male doesn&rsquo;t just traipse into this part of town without wanting something from it. Dave tells us that if we walked here at night, our reception would have been far more chilly.</p>

<p>Instead we get a blistering, smothering welcome, a tidal wave of heat, smog, clamoring hands, babies&#8217; cries, game show theme music, marching bands, basketball uniforms, fish rotting in the heat that you can almost feel them disintegrate as you walk by the markets. A drunken man I cannot see is singing in a karaoke shack, and a woman is giggling outside as she is playfully dragged back in; Ken presses more candy into my hands to give away. We barely squeeze by a couple of garbage trucks rumbling through a side street; a kid loses a sandal. A hand grabs mine, and I shake it off.</p>

<li><p>For the Kingdom to continue to move powerfully in dark places amidst poverty, spiritual strongholds and oppression.</p></li>
<li><p>Joy! That the church body there would ooze Gospel joy.</p></li>
<li><p>That the staff at the Red Window Project would be strengthened with supernatural rest, community, faith, hope, &amp; love.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/1756742112/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/1756742112_a54cf5e9a8.jpg" alt="Sensations - Awaken the Dawn" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like the evenings I spent in Central Asia years ago, sprawled on a stiff hotel bed and journaling until darkness fell. In my headphones the refrain would play: <em>in your presence, all fear is gone, in your presence&hellip;</em> And it&rsquo;s all I could cling to, because that month-or-so in that land was one of the loneliest I&rsquo;ve had.</p>

<p>That first week, as I was climbing onto the bus, a trio of teenage boys rushed off and shoved me to the side as they exited, so close you could feel the heat radiating off their brows. I thought them rude, but then caught myself and reminded myself that they&rsquo;re just boys. The thought lasted about two seconds; that was the first time I had my wallet stolen.</p>

<p>I still think about the feeling of Sosho and I crammed in the back of the bus, clutching our bags tight (myself, in particular), watching the spires of mosques pass by and watching Muslims pray on the sidewalks during afternoon prayers, their foreheads pressed into the concrete and lips moving in fervent prayer. I remember seeing a diseased boy, his arms both amputated and his face marked with sweat and soot, pleading with his eyes for his throat was parched. Our Muslim friends were generous: they gave alms to the poor, they believed Allah would reward them for their generosity.</p>

<p>The city is one of the most polluted cities in the world; it lies in a dry valley and is reputed as the most landlocked city in the world. Soot and ash from surrounding factories linger over us in a haze. Day by day, thousands of new immigrants arrive by train. The city is exploding; everybody is covered in soot; it is hot; tempers flare, a bus tire explodes and the people begrudgingly walk off the bus and wait for another to come along.</p>

<p>I also remember wandering the parks of that city, and watching the people mill about, their faces blank (as strangers generally are to other strangers), and trying to think about God but constantly being interrupted by the heat and smog, thoughts flitting back and forth from prayer to a red bean popsicle (glory!).</p>

<p>We would hear stories of busloads of South Korean tourists who would come into the city. One of the missionaries told us that they were actually followers of the Way, who would circle the great square in the center of the city and blanket it with prayers. She knew because she would see them walk about, their mouths moving inaudibly and their eyes locked onto the heart of the city and its people. She would see them and her heart would explode and she told us that she would want to shout <em>we&rsquo;re here! we follow the Way too!</em></p>

<p>The weather here is impetuous; one day it&rsquo;ll be 80 degrees and in the evening it&rsquo;ll be below freezing and snowing. It&rsquo;s much like the food, bursting with spices and seasonings and cooled with a dollop of frosty yogurt. The food, oh, I still do dream about it, the <em>lagman</em> and lamb kebabs, the feeling of growing dizzier with the sights and smells of the food stalls at the bazaars.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t very spiritually-minded on that trip, and I felt that God knew it was okay. I couldn&rsquo;t shake my homesickness on days when I&rsquo;d want to run from the oppressive heat, when the blathering of denizens would take its toll on my patience, and my stomach would rebel at the stream of foreign food I kept trying to feed it with. But still, there was that feeling&mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like the mornings I&rsquo;d take a jog out onto the deserted streets, watching the sun rise and hearing the burst of an oven igniting, the flapping of pigeon wings, the distant car horn and the slight hum of towering cranes, unofficial city guardians. And though I couldn&rsquo;t shake the homesickness, I knew I was in God&rsquo;s presence. Even today, I look back and know I was with the one they call Allah. I&rsquo;d have these visions of his grace gathering in storm clouds and falling like rain, clearing the air, turning streets into creeks and sprouting trees on their banks.</p>

<p>Soon the ash would fill my lungs and force me, coughing, to turn around and crawl back into bed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The more I stay here the more I realize that I am <em>tired</em>, I am selfish, I am resentful. I am being changed&mdash;yes&mdash;by entering the lives of people in poverty and seeing the grace of being invited into their lives. Yes, I am learning from them a simple faith and a simple life. But it is difficult, and it&rsquo;s a place I do not know how to inhabit.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to give grace to the people who drink on our doorsteps. I get resentful of people who have entitlement attitudes, and sense a creeping sense of dread of answering the doorbell to give food to folks who ask for it. I&rsquo;m tired of cleaning up human shit from our sidewalks and parking lot. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that my biggest fear is that I will annihilate myself in service, deeds, good works and on top of that <em>nothing will change.</em></p>

<p>Once Dave and I busted out onto the entranceway where homeless folks sleep on our doorstep because they were making a drunken racket. We yelled at them, hard: pointed at their beer bottles&mdash;<em>don&rsquo;t you ever drink on our doorstep again!</em>&mdash;gesticulating angrily, adrenaline flaring&mdash;<em>don&rsquo;t you lie to me! You can&rsquo;t sleep here anymore.</em> Yes, it was a power trip. No, we couldn&rsquo;t tolerate the noise and racket they were putting up. Yes, they were annoying the entire neighborhood. No, we weren&rsquo;t doing it very lovingly. Who&rsquo;s right? What was the right thing to do? Where was Jesus, and what would he have done?</p>

<p>They returned the next night.</p>

<p>I think we romanticize urban ministry sometimes, serving the poor, but have forgotten to count the cost. I often feel like that rich young ruler who, having heard Jesus&#8217; call to sell his possessions and leave a comfortable life, leaves sad. Because honestly, I do not know if I want to be here.</p>

<p>Lord, help me. Jesus, show me where you are <em>right here, right now</em>. I don&rsquo;t like dwelling in the tension of the brokenness of my neighborhood and the peace that is far away, already promised but not yet here. I know the answer is somewhere in hearing the inner voice of Love, in simply being a son and being Loved. Right now, I just feel stuck.</p>

<p>Last night I went back home to the quiet streets of Saratoga and I knew I couldn&rsquo;t go back. It didn&rsquo;t feel <em>real</em>. But I don&rsquo;t want to stay here either, swimming through the garbage in my soul and not knowing how to be well. Do I want to be well?, the Healer asks. Yes, but help my unbelief.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/?attachment_id=1416"><img src="http://www.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1300076147-500x500.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>A few cloudy Sundays ago I was watching Bruce play with Darren on the steps of our church. Screaming fire trucks were storming our street. Bruce ran down the steps, swept a wide-eyed Darren into his arms and ran down to watch the commotion fade down East 15th.</p>

<p>Darren&rsquo;s eyes were bright and mouth was agape. &ldquo;That was a fire twuck!&rdquo; he exclaimed, jabbing a stubby finger in the direction of the receding lights.</p>

<p>Man, Darren was so taken by that truck.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking lately about how simple we need to become to &ldquo;get&rdquo; to the Father heart of God. I&rsquo;m really tired of overthinking things. I&rsquo;m tired of trying to push things on my own or intellectualizing you or my purpose here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about this Imposter that I&rsquo;ve created, the image in me that I like to put forth as someone competent, artsy, smart, funny, mature. My greatest fear is that someone will discover me in the times when I can&rsquo;t keep up the ruse and find me unlovable. My Imposter can cover that for me, so I don&rsquo;t have to face the disappointment of being myself.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li></li>
</ol>


<p>I am surrounded by my friends, but this memory is unattached with context. I don&rsquo;t know where this is or how old I am (how old am I? sixteen?) But there is laughter: pale white walls of laughter, ringing in my ears. They are laughing at me (with me? something I said?) and I&rsquo;ve got this stupid smile on my face and I don&rsquo;t get it. All I can do is play along and smile, imagining they&rsquo;re not laughing at me, they&rsquo;re laughing because I&rsquo;m self-deprecating and I&rsquo;m funny and my cheeks burn, straining under the weight of this two-ton grin. Surely they see it&rsquo;s not real, but I hope against hope that nobody notices.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>I am six, buried in numbers, two by two by six by twelve by what the hell is happening. There is a wall of numbers rushing straight at me, and I can&rsquo;t think through the tears but all I know how to do is swim to the other side of the numbers. If I can trust my slipping memory, the numbers will fall out before the seconds expire and the waters won&rsquo;t overwhelm me but alas, the waves are lapping over the edge and my eyes begin to overflow.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>A memory of performing, being on stage, drinking the laughter or applause or accolades of friends. I love it here. I feel at home here. I feel powerful here. But the lights turn off and people go home to their families and I am left sitting in my car with the key in the ignition, soon to be turned if not for the weight of an inconsolable loneliness. What do you do when you pour yourself out yet you cannot drink your fill?</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Jesus, I just want to hang out with you and have you sweep me into your arms and we can run after fire trucks. Or we can do what you wanna do. I don&rsquo;t care. I just wanna be the kid with a stupid grin on his face watching his Dad do his thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m wrestling a lot these days with the idea of Justice and what it looks like to be a Christian&mdash;and a human&mdash;in the midst of it.</p>

<p>This week, the <a href="http://interns.regenerationweb.com">interns and I</a> have been at the <a href="http://www.notforsalecampaign.org/news/topic/investigator-academy/">Not for Sale Academy</a> receiving training on human trafficking before we head out to the Philippines in April. I&rsquo;m feeling a lot of heaviness, hearing stories about people held captive under another&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>A few things I&rsquo;ve been chewing on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The perversion of masculinity, a fascination (and insecurity) with power, control &amp; ego versus the created Ideal: protective, disciplined, self-sacrificing, Christlike.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m nervous about entering darkness; the thought of walking a red-light district scares me. Can I handle it? Also: thoughts on continual prayer as we walk through the shadows. We need to pray to survive.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m going with this group of guys.</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s okay to feel pain. I&rsquo;m wondering if I even want to be identified with this movement because of the heaviness surrounding it. I&rsquo;m realizing that maybe the pain of the world is what God wants us to feel&mdash;to grieve alongside the broken and the powerless and to be saddened by the injustice in the world.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other side, I&rsquo;m thankful that our God is a God of vengeance and justice. He promises to repay for evil. That is very. comforting. Honestly, I&rsquo;m not sure how I would deal with the brokenness without an Absolute, a Good framework.</p></li>
<li><p>But honestly, I mostly want to turn and go back to life as usual and pretend like I haven&rsquo;t looked into the void.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m imagining the voice of Tim Keller here). &ldquo;Jesus Christ suffered the ultimate injustice so that we can be justified&mdash;and so that the world can know Justice.&rdquo; The Gospel is that the justice that was to be exacted on the murderer, the pimp, the politician, the single mother, the CEO, the checkout clerk and me&hellip; was placed on Jesus. Augh. Grace. Bitterness-melting, soul-lifting, hope-restoring Grace.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a sexy movement. Call+Response was about rock stars. The t-shirts are fashionable. We talk about entrepreneurial ventures and new business paradigms. People I meet are well-put together. But would I still be out here if this were a movement to end homelessness? How about adoption?  I wrestle with the question about whether it&rsquo;s about me wanting to be identified as a hip, socially-aware Christian, or if I&rsquo;m actually loving people and moving out from there.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Tonight my small group simply picked up trash around our Lake Merritt neighborhood. But I was talking with Tammie and Justin about how it should be the case that a neighborhood should be better off because Christians live there.</p>

<p>It is uncomfortable and we are getting nervous with the onset of darkness. We say hello to a woman at a street corner who merely mumbles back. Lazily, a police helicopter hovers in the skies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember you most for your light-heartedness. I remember I used to play with you Sundays at Campbell and see you laughing, backpedaling from one side to another, sinking (most) your jumpers. The uptempo cut, a light-footed jumper, picking your way through lane traffic, and you&rsquo;d be cracking another joke at Joe&rsquo;s expense. In between games, you&rsquo;d sit on the far bleachers and talk shop with the other HK dads.</p>

<p>Sometimes I catch myself these days thinking of you; miscellaneous memories of you teaching Sunday school to a crowd of rowdy fifth graders, or how you&rsquo;d say something affectionate in a fatherly way to Joe to his embarrassment every time we showed up at your house to hang out. Though I didn&rsquo;t know you well Mr. Tang, this much is true: things aren&rsquo;t the same without you.</p>
