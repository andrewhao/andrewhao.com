  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m proud of you guys, having watched you grow in passion, service, grace, and humility these past five or so years. I don&rsquo;t think it hit me until finally this weekend when I was talking and praying with each of you: the realization that you are moving into a newer, better, bigger, scarier, exciting thing. Y&#8217;all come a long way now (remember the good ol&#8217; days in me and Howard&rsquo;s small group?) My prayer is that you know in your hearts that you are sons. You are fully loved, fully accepted, fully approved. May you grow into the calling God has given you. Grace be with you men.</p>

<p>And for the longest time I was (and I still am) puzzled because my God felt like another scheduleable portion of my life.

Mimeographable and rote. I couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that if I just keep following the twelve-step program I&rsquo;d end up somehow with a decent semblance of faith and facade.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wendeng, Shandong: Threatens to Confiscate Christian Worship House by Li Baiguang</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>ï¿½If you gather to preach illegally, we will confiscate your house!ï¿½</li>
</ol>


<p>One
Sunday morning before Easter 2006, six officials from the Religion
Department of Wendeng, Shandong Province came to the worship room of a
family church in Bukou Village, Bokou Port Management Committee, where
many Christians were in attendance. A Director General and a Department
Director of the Religion Department of Wendeng interrupted our meeting,
and asked Tian Yinghua, the preacher of the family church, to go to a
back room. At the same time, without permission, the officials opened
the donation box and checked the amount of money in it. To their
disappointment they only found RMB?20.00! Thus, they left the money in
the box and went away.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Director General
and the Department Director of the Religion Department of Wendeng
started to interrogate Tian Yinghua:</p>

<p>Official: You Christians should not lie.</p>

<p>Tian:
God said, ï¿½Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No, anything more than
this comes from the evil one.ï¿½ I have answered your question, we
Christians do not lie.</p>

<p>Official: The Religion Department has been here several times, you know?</p>

<p>Tian: I know.</p>

<p>Official: This is an illegal meeting, an illegal breach.</p>

<p>Tian:
We have not broken any laws, Article 36 of the Constitution of the PRC
states that ï¿½citizens enjoy the right to believe in any religion.ï¿½</p>

<p>Official:
We regulate attendance and there cannot be more than 30 people present,
and they are limited to relatives, did you know that?</p>

<p>Tian: Document No. 145 on religion states that ï¿½relatives and friends can join family religious meetings.ï¿½</p>

<p>Official: No, family meetings are limited to 30 people, if there are more, you have to register.</p>

<p>Tian:
Document No. 145 on religion states that ï¿½family meetings do not need
to register,ï¿½ if necessary, please register for us now.</p>

<p>Official: No way, go to the ï¿½Three-Selfï¿½ to register.</p>

<p>Tian:
Your words contradict yourself. You said that citizens enjoyed the
freedom to believe in any religion, when in fact we have no freedom.</p>

<p>Official: What do you think of ï¿½Three-Selfï¿½ church?</p>

<p>Tian:
The preachers of ï¿½Three-Selfï¿½ are jealous, they argue and are cliquish.
Wang Xinfeng and Zhang Jianjun fought for power. I donï¿½t think they are
the son of God, so I left.</p>

<p>Official: If you gather illegally, we will confiscate the house where you meet.</p>

<p>Then
the Director General rigorously said, ï¿½Was your house was built with
your own money or otherï¿½s money? Youï¿½d better have proof, otherwise we
will confiscate it.ï¿½</p>

<p>Tian Yinghua sternly answered, ï¿½If you
quote policy, I will listen. But you have come to bully us. I withdrew
money from the bank to build this house, the bank did not give me a
note, and how can I prove it? You said if I had no money to build a
house, you would take it away, what is your proof? Does the law
regulate in this way?ï¿½</p>

<p>The Director General and Department
Director couldnï¿½t answer and hurried away. Before they left, they
required Tian Yinghua to sign a note stating that they were holding an
Illegal get-together and illegal preaching. Tian Yinghua refused to do
so. After they left, Sunday Worship Service continued.</p>

<p>II. ï¿½If you donï¿½t stop worshipping, we will send you to reeducation through labor.ï¿½</p>

<p>At
9:40 AM, Jun 11, 2006, Hou Chengxun, the head of the Domestic Security
Protection Squad of Wendeng Public Security Bureau in Shandong and the
head of the Fifth Squad; Cong Peiqing, the head of Public Security
Squad; The Director General and a Department Director (the two officers
who once came here before Easter), led more than 50 policemen in 10
police wagons to our family church at Bukou Village, Bukou Port
Management Committee, Wendeng, and besieged the nearly 60 Christians.
They barricaded each door of the house, forbidding them to leave and
shouted into the microphone, ï¿½Stand still, get in a wagon.ï¿½ While
shouting, they continued taking photos and recording the meeting and
Christians, forbidding them to speak. If someone said, ï¿½Free belief,ï¿½
the police would cry out, ï¿½Take him/her away!ï¿½ Two believers, Liu Yujie
and Zhang Shuzheng are over 60 years old; several strong men dragged
them into a police wagon with their arms pinned backward, just like
criticizing the four categories of people during the Culture
Revolution.</p>

<p>To our surprise, as agents of national organs,
none of them showed their identifications to the Christians in
compliance with the law, not even a summons paper. Without giving them
any chance to legally defend themselves, they took these Christians to
Bukou Police Station of the Public Security Bureau of Wendeng, ignoring
their protests, where each Christian was imprisoned and interrogated in
individual rooms. This time, the Public Security Bureau of Wendeng
caught 31 Christians, the rest escaped in the chaos.</p>

<p>June 29,
2006, I met Tian Yinghua, Wang Qiu, and Jiang Rong who were just
released from prison at the chapel of Bukou family church.</p>

<p>Tian
Yinghua recalled it was Hou Chengxun, the head of Domestic Security
Protection Squad, the head of the Fifth Squad, and Cong Peiqing, the
head of Public Security Squad of the Public Security Bureau of Wendeng
who interrogated her. They clearly threatened Tian Yinghua, the
preacher, ï¿½If you still preach at the next meeting, we will sentence
you to prison, send you to Qingdao Reform School and reeducate you for
three years.ï¿½ Following is dialogue between Tian Yinghua and the
Police:</p>

<p>Police: When did you begin to believe in God?</p>

<p>Tian: 14 years ago (1992).</p>

<p>Police: Can you cure any disease?</p>

<p>Tian: I cannot. I prayed to Jesus to cure me. Before I suffered terminal breast cancer, it was Jesus who cured my disease.ï¿½</p>

<p>Police: You called up all the people?</p>

<p>Tian:
No. We welcome everyone, you also can come, when everybody believes in
Jesus society will be stable, nobody will steal, rob or do evil.</p>

<p>Police: What about the house in which you gather?</p>

<p>Tian:
It is Sister Wang Qiuï¿½s house. She borrowed money from me to send her
son abroad, and allowed me to live in her house. She will repay me
after her son comes back, if she cannot afford the money he will give
me her house.</p>

<p>Police: You gather and preach illegally. If you continue, we will sentence you to three years imprisonment.</p>

<p>Tian: Citizens enjoy the right to believe in any religion, I have not breached any law.</p>

<p>Following is the dialogue between Zhang Shuzheng, a 72-year-old Christian and the</p>

<p>Police: Why do you believe in God?</p>

<p>Zhang: I am a stomach cancer patient and once went through an operation to remove my left kidney.</p>

<p>The Police interrupted him: When did you start?</p>

<p>Zhang: 1993.</p>

<p>Police: How did you begin? Who told you to believe?</p>

<p>Zhang:
A sister told me to believe. At that time I did not believe what she
said, but just wanted to try. After I joined the church, I recovered
gradually, and never took any medicine. So I cannot live without Jesus
now.</p>

<p>Police: How much have you given to the church.</p>

<p>Zhang: We live in the countryside, different from cities; we are supported by our children and have no money.</p>

<p>Police: Why donï¿½t you go to ï¿½Three-Self?ï¿½</p>

<p>Zhang:
We cannot go there, it is managed by the Government, and there is
disagreement and cliques. We shall follow the instruction in Holy
Bible, so we cannot go there.</p>

<p>Following is the dialogue between Shi Shushuang (female, 74-years-old, became a believer in June 2005) and the Police:</p>

<p>Police: Auntie, how did you believe in Jesus?</p>

<p>Shi:
I believe in God because God is kind. I knew about it from the age of 8
years. At that time, a British missionary worked here. Last year
someone told me to come here, I feel I am late.</p>

<p>Police: Where did you buy the Bible?</p>

<p>Shi: I bought it from Nanjing, you can buy them there, there are many.</p>

<p>Police: Auntie, how much have you given the church?</p>

<p>Shi: I do not have any income, completely depending on my children, how can I have money?</p>

<p>At
the moment, Shi Shushuang questioned the Police, ï¿½What law did I
violate by believing in God? You treat us this way, not letting me to
go to the restroom, if you broke the law, would you be treated like
this?</p>

<p>Police: Auntie, you can not talk this way for you are a Christian.</p>

<p>Shi: I will talk to you this way, but I will not talk this way in front of Jesus.</p>

<p>Police: Auntie, you should believe in God in your heart.</p>

<p>Shi:
I believe in my heart &ndash; not my mouth. I am illiterate and when I come
across something I donï¿½t understand in the Bible I certainly ask a
brother or sister.</p>

<p>Following is the dialogue between
Christianï¿½Cui Yingshun (female, 41-years-old, Korean National, original
place is Jilin) and the Police:</p>

<p>Police: How long have you believed in God?</p>

<p>Cui: More than 10 years.</p>

<p>Police: How long have you been in Shandong?</p>

<p>Cui: About 10 years.</p>

<p>Police:
Did you believe when you were in the northeast? How did you get to know
the church after you came here? Who led you to the church?</p>

<p>Cui: I went there by myself, nobody told me.</p>

<p>Police: What did you do in the church?</p>

<p>Cui: We sang hymns, read scriptures, and prayed.</p>

<p>Police: Who is the head?</p>

<p>Cui: We donï¿½t have a head, everybody is equal.</p>

<p>Police: Your church believes in God, is it because you can cure disease there?</p>

<p>Cui: As for me, it can, otherï¿½s belief, I donï¿½t quite understand.</p>

<p>Police: Can you not to go to church?</p>

<p>Cui: No, I feel bad if I donï¿½t go there.</p>

<p>Police: When do you usually meet?</p>

<p>Cui: On Wednesday and Sunday in the northeast and here on Sunday.</p>

<p>Police: You cannot gather anymore.</p>

<p>Cui: It is impossible, even if you send me to prison, I will go to service.</p>

<p>Police: What is Sister Tianï¿½s name?</p>

<p>Cui: I donï¿½t know.</p>

<p>Police: You are so stubborn, I will not talk to you anymore, later those from the Religion Department will talk with you.</p>

<p>Just
as Cui Yingshun wanted to say something, the Police stopped her, ï¿½Go,
go!ï¿½ and pushed her out the door. After the Police interrogated the 31
Christians, required them to sign and fingerprint the record, they took
them into a room. Then the Director General and Department Director of
Religion Department of Wendeng appeared. Each of them took a
black-covered booklet, on which were printed and hand-written words.</p>

<p>Then
the Department Director began to teach us. His words were full of
ï¿½sympathy.ï¿½ ï¿½You live hard lives, finding it difficult to buy matches
and salt, but the money you donate to the church is unsecured. Never
let some ill-motivated person fool you. If you give money to Three-Self
church, we will secure it.ï¿½ Then the Department Director recited
religious policy according to the booklet, ï¿½Citizens enjoy the right to
believe in any religion, but do not enjoy the right to choose the
place. In the event of any further illegal meetings, we will publicly
sell the house used for the meeting.ï¿½</p>

<p>Having finished his
lesson, he told us to return home. Tian Yinghua went to Director
General of the Religion Department and to reason with him. Tin Yinghua
said, ï¿½I want to say something to clarify the truth. Why do leaders of
the Religion Department and the Public Security Bureau talk
differently? Last time, the Religion Department said a 30-person
meeting was permitted, but this time the Public Security Bureau said
even one person couldnï¿½t meet, they could only believe in God at home,
who is telling the truth?</p>

<p>The head of Public Security Squad fiercely told Tian, ï¿½Donï¿½t gab here, go back home.ï¿½</p>

<p>Sister Wang Qiu said, ï¿½You brought us here by police wagon, you should send the older sisters and brothers back.ï¿½</p>

<p>Tian said, ï¿½You should resume our reputation.ï¿½</p>

<p>Hou
Chengxun, the head of Domestic Security Protection Squad of the Public
Security Bureau of Wendeng, said, ï¿½Ok, send them back.ï¿½</p>

<p>The
head of the Fifth Squad said, ï¿½Ok, come on, I will send you back one by
one.ï¿½ The policemen agreed to take the ones who get in their police
wagon. In the courtyard of Bukou Police Station, the Policemen began to
drag people into their wagon. Several policemen grabbed female
Christian, Wang Qiuï¿½s arms and dragged her into the wagon in handcuffs
where they used electric batons and Wang Qiuï¿½s mouth bled, and blood
blisters appeared on her arms. Sister Jiang Rong, a Christian,
challenged the policemen by asking them why they beat others, the
policeman took her into the wagon without a word, and send them to
prison. Then, six policemen forced Tian Yinghua, the preacher, into a
police wagon. Tian Yinghuaï¿½s older sister, Tian Aihua, and her younger
brother, Tian Hongxu, are not Christians but witnessed the scene.</p>

<p>Afterwards
Tian Yinghua recalled that her sister and brother had gone to the Bukou
Police Station for answers and saw Tian Yinghua caught by the police.
Then Tian Yinghua saw her brother being pressed to the ground by four
or five policemen twisting his arms. When Tianï¿½s sister walked forward
the police grabbed her arms and she cried, ï¿½Today is my motherï¿½s 80th
birthday? Does your mother celebrate her birthday? Does your mother
like to celebrate her birthday in this way? My sister is a kind woman,
she believes in God, I know she does not do evil, this is her belief,
and she has to cure herself.ï¿½ Tian Yinghua said that her heart was
broken at the sight of this scene. But her mind was calm, continuing to
pray, she knew it was God who was comforting her. After her prayer she
told her mother, sister, and brother not to be sad.</p>

<p>That day the Police sentenced Tian Yinghua, Wang Qiu and Jiang Rong to 10-days detention for ï¿½illegally meeting and preaching.ï¿½</p>

<p>III. Policemen in Wendeng Prison: ï¿½You are not a Christian, you are a cult follower.ï¿½</p>

<p>Tian
Yinghua told me on the way to the prison, that the head of the Public
Security Squad of the Public Security Bureau of Wendeng said to her,
ï¿½Listen, Tian Yinghua, donï¿½t you understand? We want to send you back
home to celebrate your motherï¿½s 80th birthday and arrest you tomorrow.
You can even take the police wagon and keep your reputation. Then we
have to send you into prison today, to see whether you still want to
take our wagon, and keep your reputation. ï¿½ Having arrived at the
prison, policewoman Liu asked why she was detained. Tian answered,
ï¿½Because I believe in God.ï¿½</p>

<p>The policewomen said, ï¿½You talk
nonsense, policeman never arrest Christians, you must have disturbed
the social order under the guise of Christianity, this is a cult, a
Falun Gong Cult, Christians should go to the ï¿½Three-Selfï¿½ church to
worship.ï¿½ Then other policemen followed and said that Tian Yinghua,
Wang Qiu and Jiang Rong did not believe in God, but in a cult.</p>

<p>After
detention, Tian Yinghuaï¿½s second older brother went to pick up Tian
Yinghua at the prison. He asked the head of the Fifth Squad of the
Public Security Bureau of Wendeng why they always arrested Christian
believers who are mainly old people and women. The head of the Fifth
Squad said that Wendeng Religion Department went to the family church
in Bukou several times, there were dozens of people the first time,
about forty or fifty the second time, there were more than 60 people
the third time. At that time I had told Tian Yinghua it was an illegal
gathering and told them to stop, if not we would confiscate their house
and property. These Christians would not listen and continued to meet.
We werre afraid it was cultic activity under the guise of Christianity,
intending to overthrow the Government as Sanban Puren and Dongfang
Shandian, so we forbad their gathering.</p>

<p>The day when Tian
Yinghua left the prison, the head of the Fifth Squad warned Tian again,
ï¿½In the event that another meeting was raided, it would not be
detention. Next time it will be Weihai Police who arrests you, and they
will send you into Qingdao Reform School.ï¿½ Tian Yinghua, confused after
hearing his threats, said, ï¿½I know our country respects law and human
rights, but now I have lost the freedom to meet other Christians. I
have not broken any national law, only because I believe in God.</p>

<p>Then
what will be the result when caught next time? Will Tian Yinghua really
be sent to Qingdao Reform School like the head of the Fifth Squad said?</p>

<p>June
30, 2006, I, as the agent of Tian Yinghua, Wang Qiu and Jiang Rong,
proposed administrative reconsideration to Wendeng Municipal Government
on the administrative punishment by the Public Security Bureau of
Wendeng. I believe a legal battle to defend freedom of belief will
follow. The process may be long, but no matter whether it is a success
or a failure, it will be learning experience for legal executors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of you have wondered what it&rsquo;s like daily indulging in the opulence that are the FAQQLY offices. Allow me to take you on a tour.</p>

<p>These are known as cubicles. There are many of them, and they all look the same. Don&rsquo;t let their similarities to prison cells fool you. They are actually holding pens for geeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/201500325/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/69/201500325_d3db63cb33.jpg" alt="This is office casual." /></a></p>

<p>Hsiufan and Vicki, earlier in the summer. Note the shoes just chillin&#8217; in the corner.</p>

<p>I, being the senior techie, get my own cubicle. Note the paper clutter on the desk; it is a sure sign of productivity (and they sure help catch any runaway condiments leaking from my Subway sandwiches).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/201502725/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/64/201502725_2d23680326.jpg" alt="My workspace" /></a></p>

<p>(Three computers, four screens and a whole lotta carpal-swivel-neck-syndrome.)</p>

<p>Some whiteboard scrabble:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let the appearance of &lsquo;fun&rsquo; fool you. Dave works us like dogs. We have to, cuz he works pretty hard himself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/201501052/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/66/201501052_a53a9b86ed.jpg" alt="Dave can't leave his cubicle. Ever." /></a><br/>
It&rsquo;s pretty hard to get this guy out of his cubicle. &ldquo;Hey, wanna get lunch?&rdquo; we ask him, and he says, &ldquo;Sure, in five minutes.&rdquo; Then about thirty minutes later we finally get to pull him away off his important phone conferences and whatever he does as a Founder Person.</p>

<p>But seriously, it&rsquo;s been a ton of fun working here, getting tons of good experience, panicking like real people with real responsibilities do, learning how to run a business in a constantly changing market (the solution? work smarter, not harder. and don&rsquo;t sleep). And we do keep kidding Dave about how he drives us like slaves, but I love the guy. <a href="http://xanga.com/davewliu">His heart</a> is in the right place, for sure.</p>

<p>The tech team says &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to the summer heat I am unable to sustain a train of thought for more than a few sentences. I present: an abridged version of what&rsquo;s been in my head and my heart.</p>

<hr />

<p>Every night I get home around 9:00PM, get some food into my stomach, do half of my homework and usually fall asleep on it (I tend to sleep on the floor because I find the uncomfortable position helps me wake earlier)</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve been dealing with a lot more stress and drain than I&rsquo;ve anticipated for this summer. It&rsquo;s somewhat simple; I just don&rsquo;t have enough time to do the things I&rsquo;ve slated myself to do.</p>

<p>I tend to overestimate my capabilities (particularly when making promises to Dave or the rest of the team). So my new rule of thumb is: when giving time estimates, take your expected time frame and multiply by two (or three, sometimes).</p>

<hr />

<p>My dad has always wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor. &ldquo;Do something that makes a difference in other people&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; he tells me (Of course, he is referring to upstanding lawyers, doctors, et. al.) I can sense a regret in his voice as he admits, &ldquo;I wish I was one.&rdquo; And with a mixed expression of pride and silent sadness he looks at me, waiting for me to answer. I have none, but tread in his wake. It was my choice to follow his path to become an engineer, I remind myself. But his plea to make my life count stays with me still.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think my problem with recurring sin is not a matter of approach or method, but a matter of valuation. How much is my obedience worth to God if I don&rsquo;t express it in my joy and delight in chosen obedience? And how do I delight in God if He isn&rsquo;t my most valued treasure? So I desperately want You, God, to be supremely valued in my heart over every squalid little desire. So when I fall into the freakin&#8217; death cycle of sin, I will know deeply that You are infinitely more satisfying and run back to you. Deeper than anything.</p>

<hr />

<p>I went to the Giants game last night with Steve, Sarah and her friends, where I felt like a complete Giants-fan poser (I basically don&rsquo;t follow baseball, and now at school sans newspaper, I am completely cut off from that sphere). But the team dominated the Padres (so completely) I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel the urge to call them &lsquo;my&rsquo; team (faker).</p>

<hr />

<p>Hey (hetero) guys: Say you&rsquo;re dropping by your friend&rsquo;s apartment and he answers the door in nothing but his boxers and invites you in like it ain&rsquo;t a thing. Biggie or no biggie? (Man, I should ask this question on FAQQLY)</p>

<hr />

<p>I need to pray. I need to abide. A whole lot more. I need to know my God intimately. This isn&rsquo;t something to be put on the to-do list or on the extra credit portion of the quiz, but an urgent murmur in my heart that I keep putting aside because to be honest, it&rsquo;s easy to fake. You do it, I tell my hesitating self, not because you can look holy or pat yourself on the back. You do it because it is your lifeline. You do it because nothing will complete you or satisfy you more. You do it because you need &ldquo;streams of living water&rdquo; to quench your cynical heart. You do it because you simply have faith it will be so.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to manage my budget and track expenses. It&rsquo;s pretty scary, I&rsquo;ve discovered, how quickly money can slip through your fingers (especially if you&rsquo;re keeping track!). Throw your hands in the air if you feel this.</p>

<hr />

<p>I get the realization every so often that what I cook could quite legitimately be deemed as &lsquo;disgusting&rsquo; (And if I wasn&rsquo;t so hungry and desperate, I&rsquo;d quit chewing).</p>

<hr />

<p>Sleeping early and waking early: a clear sign of adulthood (obviously I don&rsquo;t get it yet). And plus, it&rsquo;s just good for you. A goal worthy of accomplishment (says our friend Ben Franklin).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>He is speaking, much too loudly, but nobody is listening. Slowly, deliberately, enunciating every word. He dangles his arms over the scratchy seatbacks, tossing his right leg over the neighboring seat and continues his conversation with the world. He is a ragged man, with tatters for clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m black. Do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody&rsquo;s paying attention, but everybody&rsquo;s listening. The man on his left is buried in his Chronicle, the woman to his side is engrossed in her cell phone conversation. But their stillness gives their attention away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what they did to me in prison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman seated ahead of him gives a little cough and leans to mumble something to his partner. She makes no acknowledgement of his gesture.</p>

<p>He is not drunk. He is speaking intelligently. A little smile; the motion of the train rocks his body loosely back and forth. And he continues, content in his conversation with the world.</p>

<hr />

<p>He is there again, but in different form at the bus station, with big roll-up flimsy shades and an eerie confidence about him. &ldquo;Shalom, shalom,&rdquo; he cries as he approaches two aging ladies seated on my right, &ldquo;you two look beautiful. You look absolutely beautiful.&rdquo; The 40 bus arrives just in time and they spring out of their seats in a harried rush reserved for youth.</p>

<p>He continues his colorful monologue. It sounds like a speech, and it sounds carefully rehearsed. Undoubtedly he takes great pleasure in doing so, reciting line after line, chuckling to himself in measured intervals.</p>

<p>I cannot look into his face, because I am fearful that if I lock eyes with this man he will engage me.</p>

<p>In the stillness he has an audience. Perhaps this is why he speaks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m not the initiator type (I wish I was). You won&rsquo;t find me calling people up very often, or planning events or whatnot. I used to assume I was just too busy at that given moment to do such things. But now I have free weekends, I find myself just puttering around the apartment, perfectly happy to be alone in my bubble.</p>

<p>I know this isn&rsquo;t a bad thing; it&rsquo;s somewhat linked into my personality and who I am. And it&rsquo;s somewhat of a good time for introspection, reflection and meditation. And maybe I&rsquo;m really just recovering from the 24/7-people-presence of last semester. But it&rsquo;s somewhat lonely, and I realize that I&rsquo;m more of a withdrawn personality than I would like to admit.</p>

<p>My roommate called me from SD last night to catch up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in your apartment alone on a Friday night?&rdquo; he playfully chided. I was happy he called; that phone call meant a lot. Why don&rsquo;t I do these things?</p>

<p>This is humbling: the realization I&rsquo;m another passive-aggressive Asian American male. It comes out in the summer. I&rsquo;m working on it. Man, summer life is an interesting paradox.</p>

<p>(I realize that Xanga is not the best place to air out personal issues. But heck, I&rsquo;d like to be transparent with <br/>
you and I. Humbling introspection? Check.)</p>
