  <div class="entry-content"><p>i&rsquo;m dreaming more often nowadays, but somehow they&rsquo;re not of the
type that are particularly memorable. you know, no death-defying action
scenes worthy of hollywood, i think the closest i got was waiting in
line at a McDonalds. or maybe the time i dreamed i was nodding off in
bio class, now tell me if that&rsquo;s not a) ironic and b) terrifying.</p>

<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a subconscious nudge telling me to treasure every moment
no matter how mundane it is because my life needs to be lived out to
the fullest. or maybe i&rsquo;m just making up excuses to sleep in a couple
more hours =)</p>

<hr />

<p><em>ack, i&rsquo;m so sorry. i dont have a clue what you&rsquo;re going
through. that&rsquo;s what scares me, i can&rsquo;t empathize. and i apologize because i should
have done something so much earlier. give me chance. i&rsquo;d like to hear what you
have to say, if you&rsquo;d drop your facade for just a moment&hellip;</em></p>

<p>pardon me if i&rsquo;m feeling a little guilty today, my calculus textbook just cost my mother $143.16 buckaroos. my goodness.</p>

<p>hmm.. the agape guys&#8217; sleepover on sunday was rockin&#8217; fun.. it was good to get to know some of the younger guys, pig out on junk food, battle it out on super smash, and have some awesome accountability time with each other.. that was definitely a blessing.</p>

<p>i think my urge to blog is lessening.. that&rsquo;s super cuz i can cut down on my online addiction, and not-so-super cuz i feel like somehow if i don&rsquo;t write it down, i&rsquo;m leaving some things unresolved somewhere inside.</p>

<p>and hey, teen angst&mdash; what&rsquo;s so wrong with it? and why am i not feeling any? awesome.</p>

<p><em>&mdash;random</em><br/>
i&rsquo;m proud to say that i shop at three respectable shopping institutions, twice a year:<br/>
a) old navy<br/>
b) the gilroy outlets, and best of all<br/>
c) target!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>so i had my brush with death today. okay it wasnt really a brush, it was more like a casual wave. okay, it was more like being in the same general vicinity.</p>

<p>westgate mall, 2:00PM. the air is still, the birds have stopped singing, i decide that two junior bacon cheeseburgers have not quite satisfied me yet. but i digress.</p>

<p>westgate mall, 2:00PM, stop sign. the Ford truck across from me has turned left, i start halfway across the intersection when i notice a white Acura Legend continuing right after the Ford. Inside the white Legend is a woman whom I have called Ms. Miss.</p>

<p>westgate mall, 2:00:03PM, halfway across the intersection. my Honda&rsquo;s already halfway across when <em>whoa nelly!</em> Ms. Miss must have been a little distracted. or maybe she&rsquo;s got some important business to attend to. Or maybe her house is on fire. I digress, again.</p>

<p>westgate mall, 2:00:04PM, still halfway across the intersection. Our cars are nearly kissing. The words &ldquo;State Farm Auto Insurance&rdquo; seem to flash across my field of vision.</p>

<p>westgate mall, 2:00:08PM. being the gentleman that I am (plus the fact that I dont want to be any closer than fifty yards of the Legend) I back up, and Ms. Miss, in her shiny Acura Legend, zooms off to keep her house from burning down, I hope.</p>

<p>westgate mall, 2:01PM, a parking space. I park, turn off the engine, and i think i&rsquo;ll sit here for a few minutes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>a pretty good indicator of how busy my life is would be my computer desktop. the more cluttered, filled with odds and ends and unfinished projects, the crazier life must be. extend that analogy to my room, only without the dirty socks.</p>

<p>and it&rsquo;s only gonna get busier.. but i&rsquo;m excited about it, i really am. this is what they call &ldquo;fun work&rdquo;. now that i think about it, nobody calls it that.</p>

<p>praise night last night went pretty well, props to paul yan for piecing it together =) it was fun getting reacquainted with the drums, thanks to those of you guys that came, it was awesome to see your shining (or shiny?) faces. it&rsquo;s all good cuz God&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>on a totally transparent note, i&rsquo;ve been looking for love in the wrong places.. i&rsquo;ll be catching myself secretly wanting to be like the couples walking around school or wistfully daydreaming or any of that stupid, stupid, sappy stuff <img src="http://www.xanga.com/Images/stunned.gif" alt="" /> and God&rsquo;s been telling me recently <em>wait, andrew. what do you need that i won&rsquo;t provide for you? do you think they have something you don&rsquo;t?</em> and last night, that question turned into <em>can you trust in me to provide for you? can you wait and see that my plans are so much bigger for you?</em></p>

<p>i&rsquo;m trying to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>my website is down, so xanga shall be used (as it probably shoulda been all the while)&hellip;</p>

<p>but what is there to say? i&rsquo;ve been scrabbling around pretty anxiously for the past week, and happily i think the spin cycle is dying down. here are the casualties of the past week:</p>

<p>a) my body (i&rsquo;m all conditioned for college now)<br/>
b) my friends (where&rsquo;s Andrew?)<br/>
c) my lips (lynbrook clarinets play till they bleed, baby)<br/>
d) my planner (lost.. somewhere..)<br/>
e) my brain (what&rsquo;s the professor been talking about.. for the last half hour?)<br/>
e) and finally, traces of sanity.. but happily, i didnt need that much anyways.</p>

<p>i think it&rsquo;s good, i&rsquo;m satisfied. read a couple of books yesterday that were really inspirational. thanks God, you satisfy <em>me</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>i need to get back into my blog-posting habits more often otherwise i&rsquo;m gonna lose these thoughts. goodness.. ever since my site died i&rsquo;ve lost the urge to update. i&rsquo;m happy to say though that the ProfilePlus will come back to life soon.. along with the <strong>envzn</strong> blog now to be hosted on <strong>g9labs.com</strong> woohoo! keep your eyes peeled in the next few weeks..</p>

<p>we&rsquo;ve been busy these past few weeks planning for youth group activities that are going to come up in the next two weeks.. <strong>praise night</strong> on friday, <strong>java night</strong> on saturday (please come! free food, free coffee, free PMT, and lots of people you can laugh at! (namely me)) we&rsquo;ve also got the <strong>senior sendoff</strong> coming up next friday.. i honestly can say that it will rock your socks and sock your rocks and all that good stuff.. you seniors shall have a proper farewell (all 30 of you @_@). then right up after that is a top secret project that we are sworn to secrecy about..</p>

<p>so yeah.. altogether its gonna be a lot of fun but man.. it&rsquo;s not easy. being a leader definitely has its drawbacks and responsibilities and i can honestly say that we&rsquo;re feeling it. i think i&rsquo;ve really asked for it personally cuz i cant find a way to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; sometimes.. so i&rsquo;ll take on project after another project and soon enough i&rsquo;m trapped.</p>

<p>you know how sometimes you start on a project then get so into it that you&rsquo;ve forgotten what the project was about in the first place? (yeah my fourth grade science fair project was like that) i think that sometimes we get so caught up in the details when we plan and everything that we forget why we did it in the first place.. what the focus was, who we&rsquo;re putting the event on for. so yeah.. that&rsquo;s something i&rsquo;m trying to watch out for.</p>

<p>coming back from mexico hit me pretty hard. mostly because there i saw how <strong>real fellowship</strong> in the spirit was.. then i came back to reality at home and realized.. wow.. we&rsquo;re far from perfect. especially in my youth group.. i came back and saw how Satan was really pulling us apart. i saw how people came in and didnt feel loved. i saw how hypocritical we really were. i saw rifts between people form and hearts harden. i could see the spread of apathy on us and i wasnt exempt from any of it either. don&rsquo;t get me wrong.. i know that every youth group goes through these same struggles, and i know that God has especially blessed CIA with so many awesome people. i&rsquo;m making this sound like a tragedy when honestly we should be doing victory dances.</p>

<p>but it&rsquo;s really been weighing on my heart ever since i got back. you see.. we&rsquo;ve got a long way to go. we&rsquo;re doing great, but we can be doing <strong>more</strong>. there&rsquo;s so much more real fellowship and passion and love to be unleashed.. there&rsquo;s so much more in store for us! God <strong>wake us up</strong>, make us restless.. never keep us satisfied with what we have. that&rsquo;s my prayer.</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t feel as if i&rsquo;ve said everything on my heart, but maybe now&rsquo;s not the time. till then, it&rsquo;s time for some mexico pictures!:</p>

<p><img src="http://g9.lhsclass2004.com/mexico/4.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
male bonding.. ah too much love to spread around. i think this is the only PG-rated pic we have o_O lookit greg.. he&rsquo;s having fun too =D<br/>
&mdash;edit&mdash;<br/>
the harder i look, the less PG it looks&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://g9.lhsclass2004.com/mexico/3.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
this girl&rsquo;s called <strong>kayla</strong>, she&rsquo;s one of the daughters in the family we gave the house to. cute girl =D</p>

<p><img src="http://g9.lhsclass2004.com/mexico/2.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
this is thomas, my very mature youth pastor doing his raptor impression. by the look of absolute horror on the other guy&rsquo;s face, i&rsquo;d say its pretty realistic (he&rsquo;s screaming like a schoolgirl)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>i came back ready to fly<br/>
only to have burdens dumped back on my shoulders<br/>
and i dont ask for pity.. i dont deserve any.</p>

<p>a lifeline is all she needs<br/>
but she&rsquo;s still trapped beneath the surface<br/>
beneath the weight of the world<br/>
an opportunity is all she needs<br/>
but she watches them stolen<br/>
one by precious one<br/>
a respite is all she needs<br/>
but it resides in her system<br/>
eating her from the inside out<br/>
a goal is all she needs<br/>
but they become meaningless<br/>
and blow away &ndash; chaff in the wind.</p>

<p>a smile is all she needs</p>
