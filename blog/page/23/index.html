<p>It&rsquo;s Friday and the power on my block has gone out. My small group is gathered in my apartment just hanging out by candlelight, making fun of each other (the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be).</p>

<p>When we get up to leave, I bring a candle out into the hall to help everybody find their shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so bright,&rdquo; somebody remarks. And it&rsquo;s true, that one candle is throwing light far down the hall and around the corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkness doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance,&rdquo; says my friend Emily.</p>

<p>Mm yeah. Darkness doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Think back to third grade or so. Remember those days when a kid would barf in class? He or she&rsquo;d turn all sickly pale, look down at the ground and hurl. Then all the kids around him would groan and hold their noses while shuffling outside as the janitor would come in donned in rubber gloves, sprinkling Comet all over the stained carpet. Wasn&rsquo;t it great? We&rsquo;d get five or ten minutes outside while we waited for the air to clear and the carpet to dry (and the sick kid to call his mom).</p>

<p>Come on, tell me you remember. Weren&rsquo;t those days the best?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I thought of this today, but I got a good long chuckle out of it. No, I was never the kid barfing (but let me tell you, I&rsquo;d come real close on several occasions).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post has big britches to fill if it&rsquo;s going to live up to its title. I&rsquo;m going to do my best. I was about to start writing this entry when to my amazement (and slight horror), I discovered <a href="http://www.xanga.com/mitsuboy/629240865/item.html?nextdate=last">Justin has already written it</a>. Big ups to him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to tie down three recent themes in my life as they relate to manhood and mission:</p>

<h4>A desire to become a man</h4>

<p>When I talk about &ldquo;becoming a man,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean the desire to kill animals with my bare hands. I&rsquo;m referring to developing character qualities of leadership, integrity and Godliness. I&rsquo;m talking about becoming a man worthy of trust, good to his word, and nurturing those in his care. I want to be a man known for physical and spiritual discipline. And most importantly, it&rsquo;s about getting huge [biceps] (kidding).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m understanding that my recent desire to <a href="http://blog.g9labs.com/2007/11/19/growing-up-aint-hard-to-do/">move forward in life</a> is a tad more than just wanting to &ldquo;grow up,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the whole package deal of becoming a man. It&rsquo;s not just grabbing onto more responsibilities, it&rsquo;s the desire to fill the role I have as a leader, provider and nurturer. That gives me a good framework for thinking about the following two things:</p>

<h4>Discipline and becoming a soldier</h4>

<p>Paul, in Scripture, pulls no punches when he&rsquo;s talking to young Timothy, a man not much older than myself:</p>

<blockquote><p> Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. (2 Timothy 2:3)</p></blockquote>

<p>That means sticking it out. That means giving myself completely to the service of the King. That means not wimping out when the times get tough or I don&rsquo;t get my way.</p>

<p>As Paul writes shortly prior:</p>

<blockquote><p>For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline. (2 Timothy 1:7)</p></blockquote>

<p>The way to develop character and spiritual maturity is through disciplines (and let the Spirit do the transformation). It&rsquo;s very much like a training regimen, right?</p>

<p>A good soldier must go through training. It&rsquo;s going to suck. But the good soldier &ldquo;makes [his] body [his] slave&rdquo; in preparation for the suffering ahead. I don&rsquo;t know who made following Jesus sound easy or painless, but the cost is high. The body count is high. The good soldier trains anyways, because:</p>

<h4>The mission: Fighting for joy</h4>

<p>I hear this one clearly. As a soldier, you must <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Articles/ByDate/1995/1539_How_Shall_We_Fight_for_Joy/">fight for joy</a>. Your mission is to see Him for who he is. Everything&rsquo;s working against you&mdash;your loudest doubts, your selfish motives, your deepest fears, your darkest guilts, your parent&rsquo;s expectations, your glaring insecurities, the American milk of prosperity. Your mission is to pursue him hard&hellip; and to join fellow friends, soldiers, journeymen &amp; women along the way.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it easy to fall back on your butt and just feel sorry for yourself? Isn&rsquo;t it easy to just take the easy pickings from life&rsquo;s spoils and call it your just reward? I think there&rsquo;s something bigger in the woodwork.</p>

<p>So get up, soldier, and let&rsquo;s go. The Reward, the prize, the treasure is great&mdash;the gift of the Father himself. In Him we find our full joy and fullest satisfaction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>O, America!</p>

<p>I was going to boycott Black Friday as a statement against American materialism. Really, I pinky-swear. Plus, I didn&rsquo;t want to stiff-arm any more grandmas in the electronics aisle.</p>

<p>(Ooh, 2 gigabytes of memory for 15 bucks!)</p>

<p>My will was broken. I got weak-kneed and kind of giggly like a little schoolgirl while on my way to Fry&rsquo;s. <em>Cha-ching!</em></p>

<p>O, America!</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But I really can&rsquo;t keep dodging the obvious questions forever, right? where was this shirt made? Can capitalism ever be biblical? Why is image such a prominent facet of our culture? What does God think of it all?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I get kind of excited to think about what I could be doing in the next step of my life. The idea of working in an area of industry I&rsquo;m passionate about, striking out on my own, entering new relationships, and managing new responsibilities is really attractive (and deathly frightening, but I&rsquo;ve already <a href="http://weblog.xanga.com/gsgnine/623210685/item.html">covered that</a>).</p>

<p>The idea that I have so many things to learn, so many places to go, and so much character to develop is intruiging to me. I think this is a byproduct of being really dissatisfied with who I am now (I feel too young). So when anticipating this after-college transition puts my identity in flux, I start itchin&#8217; to get to the final part.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that two years ago I thought I had it all figured out. These days, I have far less to be confident about, and I think that&rsquo;s a good thing. I have so much more to experience; I have so much more to try, fall, fail &amp; learn.</p>

<p>One of the authors in Scripture describes life as a foot race, in which he &ldquo;presses on toward the goal&rdquo; for the &ldquo;prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; God forbid I give up now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Disclaimer: about 95% of you won&rsquo;t get this. The other 5% should consider getting a life.</em></p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re in CS lecture (this is with Prof. Papadmitrou), and one student in the front raises his hand and asks, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the Traveling Salesman Problem not yet proven NP-complete?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Papadmitrou turns around with a concerned expression on his face. &ldquo;No, it is definitely NP-complete. What makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno. I just thought I heard you say it or read it somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is most definitely NP-complete.&rdquo; Papadmitrou talks for a few moments about why it is so. &ldquo;I should know, I proved it in my thesis.&rdquo; Then he follows it up with this smile.</p>

<p>Our jaws all drop.<em> </em>Everybody&rsquo;s thinking the same thing:<em> </em>this man is a <em>gangster</em>. There is laughter and applause for a minute or two.</p>
