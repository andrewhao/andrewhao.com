  <div class="entry-content"><p>i&rsquo;m going to try to recap mexico as best as i can remember.. and as best as i can read from my scribbled journal. i&rsquo;m sorry but i&rsquo;m gonna go into hyperdetail in the rest of this entry.. just feel free to skim through it. well here we go, <strong>Andrew&rsquo;s Wonderfully Wonderful Trip to Mexico And He Didn&rsquo;t Even Get Diarrhea.</strong></p>

<p><strong>monday</strong>: we meet up at SV and head out for a six hour trip in a six van caravan. yes folks, that&rsquo;s six hours of pastor thomas&#8217; crazy antics behind the wheel and more 80s songs than i could stand.. but hey it could&rsquo;ve been worse &ndash; we had AC. the poor mazda MPV behind us didn&rsquo;t (sorry guys). anyways about 29 of us from the CCIC team are here (we&rsquo;ve combined the san jose and south valley churches) combined with about 7 other churches here at the Youth With a Mission (YWAM) base in LA.. that&rsquo;s about 120 people total here. what&rsquo;s awesome is that there&rsquo;s groups from all over the place.. chicago, connecticut, canada.. california (i see a pattern here). MVCCC (mtn view chinese christian) is here too so there were quite a few familiar faces (lian, fish, josh wang, etc) =D</p>

<p>it is <strong>HOT</strong> here.. i&rsquo;d say in the 90s to the low 100s &lsquo;=( yeah not only that but it is humid beyond belief.. stand outside for more than 30 seconds and you&rsquo;ve got a sheen of sweat on ya. well i guess bringing the sleeping bag was a little redundant =D</p>

<p>Randy, our speaker this week is just a plain funny guy with a heart for God.. he told us some pretty amazing stories of normal people doing amazing things when they just plug into God&rsquo;s will. man.. God&rsquo;s amazing me with the way He speaks and responds to people who desire it and who listen.. if i could only have that.</p>

<p><strong>tuesday</strong>: when i slept last night i kept feeling the sheet stick to me and it was one of the few times that i could just feel my SKIN aaaaahh! yeah i lay in bed for a good hour (cuz we can&rsquo;t shower until a certain time in the morning) and goodness.. that was probably the longest hour in my life. but sallgood.. i&rsquo;ve committed to quit whining. told God last night i was gonna give up these next 9 days to Him.. no matter how miserable i was, no matter how unclean i was. God just teach me how to endure hardships like you did.. but i still know nothing in comparison to what You went through..</p>

<p>so it turns out that i&rsquo;m working with junny, miyako, patricia, thomas and edward in the drama &ldquo;liquid&rdquo;. it&rsquo;s a skit set to the jars of clay song &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; (no surprise there =D). it was a lot of fun learning it with the other two groups (one from chicago/chi-CAH-GAH, other from texas) and it&rsquo;s been really rewarding.</p>

<p>worship here is rockin&#8217; and it sounds great! that can also be a negative thing cuz i find myself sometimes getting pulled out of worship and turning it into a concert. its really cool cuz the SV guys are really into it and its awesome to be worshipping next to em.</p>

<p>tonight was pretty powerful.. Randy talked about roadblocks and obstacles that keep us from God.. a lot of em really convicted me with my pride and other personal issues that i&rsquo;d been struggling with. there was something called the &ldquo;passion play&rdquo; after that.. a dramatic reenactment of Jesus&#8217; death on the cross. but there was something more powerful than that.. cuz nailed on the cross next to Jesus was every single messed up thing i did and every messed up part of me that ever was. yeah it drove the point home how much God loved me and all my screwed upped-ness enough to die for the stupid things that i&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<p><strong>wednesday:</strong> i&rsquo;m just totally struck by the friendliness and the enthusiasm of the people here.. staff workers and the other youth groups as well. everybody&rsquo;s so pumped for God and flashing smiles and welcomes to other people. honestly if i could imagine what heaven looked and felt like, this would be pretty close (minus the heat, bugs and the gassiness)</p>

<p>tonight we had a time just to wait on God and let him speak to us.. i dunno why but every time i&rsquo;ve tried to sit still and listen to God i&rsquo;ve come away frustrated. i walked outside desperate to hear God&rsquo;s voice and pleaded &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t You speak?&#8221;<br/>
and suddenly i became so convicted.. God told me &#8220;you havent given something up to me.. you&rsquo;re not ready to give me your future.&rdquo; gosh.. i hadnt even realized it.. i couldn&rsquo;t bear to give up my future. my dreams of going to college, of making $$, of living a comfortable life. i was afraid of God &ldquo;wasting me&rdquo; as stupid as it sounds.. i thought i knew what was best for my life. i&rsquo;d tell God &ldquo;i love You and i&rsquo;ll do anything&hellip; as long as it means I go to collge.. as long as it means i have job security.. as long as it means i have $$.&rdquo; not that those things are wrong in themselves, but i selfishly kept them to myself instead of trusting God to provide. i lied to you, God.</p>

<p>Moses (he&rsquo;s an awesome staff counselor) came over to me and prayed with me and seeing his story about beeing a druggie with nothing and transforming to a man of God really moved me. shoot if God can change a man so down in life with nothing left&hellip; what can He do with me? its kind of exciting and scary at the same time. i&rsquo;m afraid of being uncomfortable. that&rsquo;s it, plain and simple. but God softened (and he&rsquo;s still softening) my heart and i&rsquo;m really beginning to open up my heart and learn how to sacrifice.</p>

<p>Peter Fong said that the way you know you&rsquo;ve met God is that he&rsquo;ll give you images or words that are totally random and that you never would&rsquo;ve thought about by yourself. man i&rsquo;m going to have to try it out for myself. i&rsquo;ve got a lot to learn.</p>

<p><strong>thursday</strong>: i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;m gonna forget the look on Mercedes&#8217; face when i played w/ her.. that sheer excitement that flashed across her face as she chased Thomas and me across the playground (we screamed like little schoolgirls =D). i&rsquo;m not gonna forget Abner&rsquo;s self-defeating statement &ldquo;i&rsquo;m no good at sports&rdquo; and watching his face light up when i told him otherwise after playing vball with him. big smiles..ear to ear. the ministry outreach at hient beyond what i had expected.. way beyond my puny dreams.</p>

<p>we went to a small park tonight in a predominantly Armenian neighborhood to do a warmup practice for our creative arts presentations. it was so hard for me to believe we were beginning to actually do ministry work.. scary and exciting at the same time. three words i&rsquo;ve gotta learn: get over yourself!</p>

<p>i gave my testimony and honestly i didnt know what to say.. so i went up there and went in every which way. but i guess the holy spirit stepped up to the plate and pinch-hit for me.. i looked into the eyes of the people there and i just felt the holy spirit telling me to talk about something else. i dunno.. that was pretty cool seeing God at work real-time.</p>

<p>talking and playing and praying with the kids afterwards was so much fun.. from playing tag to wallball with bossy girls wow.. we were on fire! it was seriously a beautiful sight. honestly i don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any place i&rsquo;d rather be.</p>

<p>had an awesome time of sharing tonight and it&rsquo;s cool to see God working in the team. off to mexico tomorrow.. should be a pretty long day =)</p>

<p>&mdash; and that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m going to post for now cuz i&rsquo;m pooped.. more of these long memoirs at a later time. take care all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>this is my first real xanga entry. </strong>is that not exciting? so until i can get my blog up and running again i&rsquo;ll be storing my thoughts up here on good ol trusty xanga.</p>

<p>so since it&rsquo;s been such a long time between updates i&rsquo;m going to have to really wreck my brain to catch up. where to begin? let the wreckage commence.</p>

<p><strong>college workshops. </strong>how did i come out of it? pretty darn confused. and a whole lot more panicked. dear reader, i wanna get this whole college major thing down the <strong>first time around</strong>. too bad its like taking a half court shot at the buzzer when you&rsquo;re three feet tall in Game 7 of the NBA Finals with the score tied, the fans screaming and 50 million eyes watching your shorts accidentally drop to your knees. yeah, and you thought this was easy.</p>

<p><strong>running</strong>. here&rsquo;s the rules: left foot right foot left foot right foot.. and don&rsquo;t hurt yourself for heavens sakes. xc practice is going pretty well.. besides the fact i get burned during every workout and i&rsquo;m hurting after every one. no shin splints yet! which is quite surprising cuz i expected them to pop up without warning, kind of like bad 80s songs on the radio. i went up to run the trails just yesterday.. very refreshing, very beautiful views and very tiring. and the horse poop on the trails just made it even more.. aromatic.</p>

<p><strong>piano</strong>. well i started up again. the other day i was playing my new piece, beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pathetique&rdquo;. one thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p><em>how fitting.</em></p>

<p><strong>responsibilities</strong>. you know what i&rsquo;m learning? hey man, you can&rsquo;t do it all. i&rsquo;ve been pretty overwhelmed by things i&rsquo;ve taken on.. responsibilities that i can&rsquo;t always handle. committments that i havent necessarily planned for and shoot.. suddenly i&rsquo;m in too deep. trust me none of these things are bad by themselves but then they start adding up.. phew..</p>

<p><strong>hair:</strong> the fro&rsquo;s gone and my head feels so much lighter.. goodbye fro.. you were truly unforgettable. as well as unmanageable.</p>

<p><strong>R&amp;R:</strong> so on that note my parents suggested i schedule some relaxation time to myself.. (yeah where did that come from? i must be really showing it) so today, on a low tank of gas, i head out to the foothills to do some aimless driving. so i discovered some key things.. a) stevens creek does have a dead end.. at the cement factory b) the cement factory has scary security guards and c) you don&rsquo;t want to be at the cement factory.</p>

<p>so there i was driving 15 miles an hour up a windy road blasting and singing along to classic tuneskies (why don&rsquo;t people say &ldquo;tuneskies&rdquo; anymore? is it too cool for them?).. all windows down to increase wind drag and wondering where the next restroom was..</p>

<p><em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash; (here we go) &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</em></p>

<p>haha allright i&rsquo;m gonna be serious for a sec here. i decided to stop at the stevens creek reservoir for a bit, not really knowing why i did. i was sitting by the car and taking in the view when the verse &ldquo;be still and know i am God&rdquo; popped into my head. okay God.. what are you trying to say here? honestly how simple is that? i guess God just wanted me to stop and just.. <em>know</em> He was there.</p>

<p>we discussed this at the cell leader meeting this afternoon: how with the more free time we have, sometimes we subconsciously try to avoid God more and more. and i guess i was trying to paint God out of the picture.. i was trying to make loopholes.</p>

<p>okay i&rsquo;m just gonna go with my stream of consciousness right now.. lately i&rsquo;ve been feeling so detached from God. you know what i mean? when you&rsquo;re stuck in a guilt cycle and you keep failing over and over. soon enough you think you&rsquo;re not worthy.. you dont deserve to come into God&rsquo;s presence anymore. that is the number one lie that Satan plants in your head, and i fell for it. i was afraid to ask for forgiveness cuz i was afraid of breaking it again.</p>

<p>its awesome cuz in this small group a bunch of us are doing over summer we went over how paul describes <strong>freedom in christ</strong>. but the problem is that <strong>we don&rsquo;t believe it</strong>.. we keep ourselves chained to our guilt and beat ourselves up over how horrible we are. <strong>freedom</strong>..<strong> </strong>that&rsquo;s a pretty powerful word.</p>

<p>gah its starting to make sense to me right now.. i was stuck in this prison of guilt that i created for myself and so i found myself avoiding God&rsquo;s presence even more. and this whole time God was waiting with open arms, but stupidly i couldnt accept the fact that i was forgiven. and in essence, i&rsquo;ve been fighting this battle for years now.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>_man i was feeling (and even now.. i&rsquo;m still feeling) far from God. and that&rsquo;s how it should be.. we should be feeling empty cuz dude.. there&rsquo;s this totally undescribable feeling of being fulfilled when you&rsquo;re in God. i used to know what it was like.</p>

<p>they say you dont know what you got till its gone. well it&rsquo;s gone now and i&rsquo;m desperate to have it back.</p>

<p><em>these tears that plead for rain<br/>
</em>knocking on the door of heaven__</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m gone these next two to three weeks&hellip; i&rsquo;ll be going up to the DCLA conference up in sacramento then five days later i&rsquo;m down in Mexico doing some missions work with my church. i&rsquo;d really like these next few weeks to be of rediscovery.. my relationship with God has grown so stagnant and i&rsquo;m the one to blame. could you guys pray for me? i&rsquo;m going to need it, thanks =)</p>

<p><em>been so long since i&rsquo;ve heard your voice<br/>
been so long since i&rsquo;ve fallen in love<br/>
ignored you and tried to fly on my own wings</em></p>

<p><em>and<br/>
fell.<br/>
__<br/>
now its a love song for a savior i wanna sing.</em></p>

<p><em><br/>
</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br/>
that&rsquo;s my first knee-slappin down-home-goodness xanga post, and my has it been strange. thanks for getting all the way down here, now get out of here before that mug on the profile picture scares your little brother. i think i&rsquo;m kidding.</p>

<p><strong>gone fishin&#8217; &ndash; be back in a few weeks.<br/>
</strong><em>-andrew</em></p>
