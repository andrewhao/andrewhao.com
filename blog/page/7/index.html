  <div class="entry-content"><p>Soon comes spring; and children will sigh in the rhododendron light. Forty days, the land groaned under the burden of frost and dust. I think to myself that were we to drink the ashen calendar days, we could not bear the surprise of heart-sick laughter, the lightness best experienced with others; a choked-up kind of glee that pounces suddenly without explanation. Does a bird think to itself, <em>thankgodi&#8217;malivethankgodi&#8217;malive</em>? I have a suspicion the children know; they have watched and waited for the light. Soon we, too, shall awaken.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight, we watched a video in Stephen Ministry that left me moved and feeling heavy at the same time. Dr. Diane Langberg spoke a message about the reality of brokenness and suffering in our lives and the need for compassionate Christians to sit with the hurting and minister with presence.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about human dignity, suffering, humanity, real-ness&hellip; a lot of swirling thoughts in my head. What does it mean that we live in the suffering of the &ldquo;not-yet&rdquo; and the reality of the &ldquo;already&#8221;ness of the kingdom? I&rsquo;m headed to the Philippines in less than three months preparing myself to face the realities of the sex trade and&hellip; I sense some fear in myself I&rsquo;m trying to stuff away. What if I can&rsquo;t handle the darkness?</p>

<p>Suffering has a contagious quality about it, and that&rsquo;s why we avoid it. I fear being drawn in to people&rsquo;s pain. I can easily wear a mask that displays a concern about justice with a capital J, as if I were noble and proud and compassionate. But between you and me, I fear compassion. I fear empathy and much rather prefer self-preservation.</p>

<p>Looking back, a lot of my life has been played in a role, idolizing perfection, a good outward image, wearing a mask, and covering my weaknesses. Personal pain, thank God, smashed a lot of my masks and is helping me recover from my notions of being likable, competent, powerful, attractive.</p>

<p>In Isaiah 61, we hear about God&rsquo;s promise to redeem the brokenness of the world through Jesus and his eventual coming. The Gospel moves to bring &ldquo;good news to the poor&rdquo;, &ldquo;bind up the brokenhearted&rdquo;, and provide &ldquo;beauty for ashes.&rdquo; But embedded deeper into the passage is a promise of the &ldquo;day of vengeance of our God&rdquo;&mdash;that makes us squirm a little bit. But the more I think about this, I realize I am happy that our God is just, fierce, vengeful, Good. &ldquo;Our God is capable to redeem suffering,&rdquo; Dr. Langberg said. And even more than that, our God himself suffered at the hands of men like me and you.</p>

<p>What do we speak to the unfathomable horrors of a girl who is sold into sex slavery, the despair of a woman who is abused by her husband, the self-hatred of the boy molested by his uncle, the loneliness of the middle-aged man still feeling the rejection of middle-school? We as compassionate humans are called into the strangely attractive, &ldquo;divine vocation of suffering.&rdquo; What does that mean? I want to know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re all holding hands on the street. Bear on my left, a stocky, grizzled Filipino dude wearing a hard expression under squinting eyes. Pancho on my right, a wiry black man with a thin face and a black &ldquo;OAKLAND&rdquo; beanie with big, gothic lettering. Cece is between the men, finishing a prayer: &ldquo;And keep us alllll&rdquo;&mdash;she draws out the word in her Native-American accent&mdash;&ldquo;safe from the <em>Devil</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amens all around.</p>

<p>Cece is direct, and I like that about her. She&rsquo;ll show up at the door and ask for a couple bucks for bus fare, or maybe a hot meal for the evening. No BS about your place burning to the ground, or needing travel fare to visit your newly-discovered relatives in Tuscon.</p>

<p>She reminds me of a bird, her beaked nose giving rise to sleepy eyes encased with gold wire-rimmed glasses. She waves her head about when she speaks, side-to-side like a pigeon&rsquo;s. You can see it particularly when she&rsquo;s off on one of her rambling episodes, going off about the weather, or about her Christmas, or the long bus route to Richmond, where she and her son Lamoine used to live in a shelter. Tonight&mdash;&ldquo;I got two kids with me&rdquo; &mdash; I am surprised to discover they are a little older.</p>

<p>Bear and Pancho, as far as I can tell, are Cece&rsquo;s friends, mid-twenties men dressed in black, hands in pockets and (I think) looking dangerous. I heat the food and find the three of them are waiting on the railing off to the side of our front entrance, where churchgoers are warily exiting the evening service. I drop off the food before Cece, who along with Pancho begin rifling through the contents.</p>

<p>Pancho slaps my hand in greeting and immediately informs me he used to sleep on the steps out here. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen me around.&rdquo; Come to think about it, he does seem familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheee-yit&rdquo; Bear exclaims with a smirk, &ldquo;Can I tell you a story? Some spirits live out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>eveningtime, it is bitterly cold, he wakes to the sensation of being lifted and dragged. upward, upward he floats. he is flailing, someone, something has snatched him by the leg and he is now ten, twenty, thirty feet in the air (up by the tower, he gestures up overhead). he is let down and on his leg are finger marks, scratches, blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sleeping here no more.&rdquo; He stares out into the parking lot, a blank expression on his face. Bear has found another place to stay by the McDonalds on 17th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah right, you can believe a lotta things,&rdquo; Pancho exclaims as he digs through a macaroni plate with his fingers. &ldquo;You was just crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that,&rdquo; I tell them. &ldquo;That stuff happens.&rdquo; Bear gives me a worried look, which turns to confusion.</p>

<p>Cece interjects, &ldquo;the <em>Devil</em> is REAL. He come to get me in my <em>dreams</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>she is a teenaged girl, though raised in a native american church out on 98th ave (her uncle was a priest) she left the Great Spirit to live the wild life, and oftentimes in her dreams she sees a figure, dark, red eyes, hovering. it is often hard to breathe and she has to try with all her strength to whisper the name of jesus, jesus, jesus. these days, the devil is after her nephew who presses a knife into her hands and tells her with a fearful smile: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need it, moms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that too,&rdquo; I say, and Cece smiles, looking around, satisfied.</p>

<p>Pancho knocks me on the forearm and chuckles, gesturing to Bear and Cece. &ldquo;Listen, I think the Devil ain&rsquo;t what we see in the movies with the <em>horns</em> and maybe the pitchfork. He&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t elaborate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that shit&rsquo;s real man, I ain&rsquo;t never coming out here again.&rdquo; Bear interjects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Devil</em> is REAL. He come to me in my DREAMS!&#8221; Cece has gone off rambling again, her voice whiny and raspy and full of trembling fear. Her eyes dart about as her head bobs and her voice shrinks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t gotta be afraid when we got God on our side.&rdquo; Pancho finishes.</p>

<p>We talk about Jesus. It&rsquo;s crazy, like a little church service.</p>

<p>Pancho: &ldquo;You know, I think Jesus beat the devil by going to the cross we don&rsquo;t gotta be afraid no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;I think that the name of Jesus is powerful and even the demons have got to submit to his name. I&rsquo;ve seen stuff like this happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bear: &ldquo;For real?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pancho: &ldquo;Oh <em>yeah</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cece is still rambling.</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;For real. You need to call on Jesus next time that stuff happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bear: &ldquo;Listen man, can we have a prayer? I could use a prayer tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cece quiets down and nods her head.</p>

<p>Without a word, everybody extends a hand. Bear starts the prayer (&ldquo;Um I don&rsquo;t know how to do this man&rdquo;), Cece finishes us off (&ldquo;Aaaaa-man!&rdquo;). And amen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ideas I&rsquo;m toying with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There is grace to be human, mess up and be accepted still.</p></li>
<li><p>There is forgiveness to be extended to humans who mess up.</p></li>
<li><p>There is freedom to say what&rsquo;s on your mind and be authentic.</p></li>
<li><p>There is just so much more freedom in general than I realize. I don&rsquo;t have to wear a mask.</p></li>
<li><p>Being assertive means at all times, I have the right to choose how I feel and how I act out of that.</p></li>
<li><p>If I mean my no&rsquo;s, then my yeses mean so much more.</p></li>
<li><p>The Gospel is real. It is powerful. It is what I/we/this world need(s).</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At about 10AM this morning in the middle of Albert&rsquo;s sermon, Mrs. Hu bursts into the sanctuary and I hear a flurry of hurried murmuring behind me and the flutter of a hundred heads turning. &ldquo;Someone call 911!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hu, wife of Pastor Jack Hu of the Chinese congregation we share our church with, was robbed at knifepoint this morning in our parking lot. A young man cornered her as she was getting out of the car and threatened her for her purse.</p>

<p><em>What the hell?</em> Someone would rob a middle-aged lady on a Sunday morning in front of our church in broad daylight?</p>

<p>Pastor Jack later on that morning greets me warmly as he usually does with a warm, two-handed handshake. His hands are soft: a minister&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew,&rdquo; (he addresses me with grandfatherly affection), &ldquo;Oakland needs Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eighteen years ago, Pastor Jack is leading a prayer meeting in the chapel when a man runs in, grabs him and holds a knife up to his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; Howard, an old-timer at our church tells me later. &ldquo;That man robbed everyone in that prayer meeting while they knelt on the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, Mrs. Hu&rsquo;s hands are bleeding, and Pastor Hu is holding onto mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any money, but I have the Gospel,&rdquo; Pastor Jack tells the man with the knife held to his head. I imagine that his eyes are bright and his hands are warm, even as they are held against his back.</p>

<p>Eighteen years later, Pastor Jack&rsquo;s family and his aging Mandarin-speaking congregation are still here in Oakland, a city they still believe needs Jesus. They are a congregation that believes in staying rather than fleeing. They are Chinese believers who live out Gospel renewal, leaving a generational legacy that I am proud to call my own.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a>, one evening, recorded a spiritual experience he had. It affected him so much that he sewed it into the lining of his coat until his death. He titled it <em><a href="http://www.thecatholicthing.org/content/view/2164/2/">The Memorial</a></em>:</p>

<p>I just came across this verse (1 Peter 4:8) and realized that God was rocking me with it. I mailed it to the other interns (text: &ldquo;bah!&rdquo;) because they know how hard it is for me to serve people I don&rsquo;t get along with. But&hellip; like <a href="http://themarrow.wordpress.com/2010/12/14/lust-prayer-pain/">Justin mentioned the other day</a>, what if we changed our attitude a little?</p>

<blockquote><p>The thought that hit me was: what if, instead of this grumpy and hard to love person, it was a female I was attracted to that had this need? Man, the reaction would have been COMPLETELY the opposite. Even if I didn’t have my own computer, I would be searching high and low for any way to fulfill that need… And not even necessarily for someone I really loved or truly cared about, just some girl… This was convicting.</p></blockquote>

<p>What if we could love people in that way? Of course, we love the difficult people that we&rsquo;re called to love, that are &ldquo;in our bundles&rdquo; &mdash; we can&rsquo;t love everybody in that manner. But what if God was calling you to love someone difficult?</p>

<p>But on the other hand, it&rsquo;s kind of reassuring to also identify with a church whose natural tendency was to grumble. And I&rsquo;m learning to set a boundary on my love &mdash; to say no when I&rsquo;m honestly not ready to love someone, but also to say yes and take a risk that someone just might receive it well.</p>

<p>Regen, let&rsquo;s choose to love that way.</p>
