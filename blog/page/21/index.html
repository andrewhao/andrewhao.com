  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m back at school for less than a week when I get a call from Mike&mdash;&ldquo;Hey Drew, I&rsquo;m in front of the food court. Come see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve collected our gifts for him&mdash;gloves, a scarf, AC Transit ride tickets, a Sony boombox, and a 12-pack of D batteries&mdash;into a corner of my apartment (<a href="http://blog.g9labs.com/2007/12/24/a-brother-like-you/">thank you, all 9 of you, for contributing!</a>) and tuck them into a Trader Joe&rsquo;s bag on the way out.</p>

<p>I find Mike walking out of the food court. He&rsquo;s lumbering towards me with a particularly strange grin on his face. He pauses right before he reaches me, cocks his head, leans over and gives me a particularly big hug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You okay man?&rdquo; I half-jokingly ask. &ldquo;Had anything to drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, Drew,&rdquo; he replies. I&rsquo;m not sure whether to believe him, but I let it drop.</p>

<p>Mike loves the gifts, and is particularly thrilled by the stereo. &ldquo;I gotta thank you, Drew.&rdquo; I tell him it&rsquo;s a gift from all of us, which only makes his smile wider.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ya know, let me tell you something, Drew,&rdquo; he begins. &ldquo;I just got outta the hospital last week. My arm started hurtin&#8217; real bad. Gotta go back in there and get my medication.&rdquo;  He looks up, giving his attention to a man walking out of the food court.</p>

<p>The man holds out an open carton of Marlboros. Mike pulls one out and slaps the man on the back, then returns his attention to me. &ldquo;Yeah, anyways Drew, I got outta the hospital and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mike, you can&rsquo;t be smoking now. It&rsquo;s gonna put you back in the hospital,&rdquo; I interject.</p>

<p>Mike doesn&rsquo;t hear me. Cigarette Man&rsquo;s lends Mike a lighter. &ldquo;I just been real stressed,&rdquo; Mike continues as he lights up, &ldquo;Belinda&rsquo;s son got caught stealing an&#8217; now he&rsquo;s in jail&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He takes a long drag and the tip of the cigarette glows bright orange in the evening darkness. Mike looks up and shifts his footing around on the pavement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, hold on,&rdquo;  I tell him. &ldquo;Belinda&rsquo;s got a son too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he thirty years old. Got caught for robbery and now he&rsquo;s all in the system. Got Belinda <em>trippin</em>&hellip;&rdquo; he tells me.  &ldquo;And Belinda, don&rsquo;t let me get started on her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s rolling the cigarette between his hands, unsure whether to crush it or cradle it.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>There is an woman, dirty, aging and obviously homeless, huddled in the corner of the food court. She drapes herself in a pea-green fleece blanket and stares into the Kingpin Donuts wall. Customers file in and out of the store, never seeing her. She is there for an hour before she leaves. She never makes eye contact with anybody; she just stares at the wall and shivers.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this is mine now, Drew?&rdquo; Mike asks, pointing at the stereo. &ldquo;Man, oh, man, ever since my last one got stolen&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s last stereo was stolen in the utility entrance to the Asian Ghetto food court. One day he locked it up in the alleyway on his way to work washing the outdoor court. An hour later he went back into the alley and it had been stolen.</p>

<p>Restrooms are scarce commodities on the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think my friend did it,&rdquo; Mike says. &ldquo;Tell me, &lsquo;Hey Mike, I got to go to the bathroom&rsquo; so I toss him the keys. I check it out later and it&rsquo;s gone. It&rsquo;s gotta be him, he hide it and sneak it away from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are no such thing as friends on the street.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s plugging in the batteries into the boombox and turns the dial to <em>KBLX</em>. Whitney Houston is on, and he turns it up so Whitney&rsquo;s singing loud enough to envelop us.</p>

<p>It startles me how fast he turns around and starts walking up the street. &ldquo;Ma&#8217;am?&rdquo; he&rsquo;s asking, &ldquo;Ma&#8217;am!&rdquo; I have to squint to see who he&rsquo;s talking to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the homeless lady by the donut shop. She&rsquo;s stood up and walked up to the curb. As Mike walks up to her, I see her quickly part her legs, bend over and urinate all over the sidewalk. I turn away.</p>

<p>Mike spins around and walks right back. &ldquo;Man!&rdquo; There is a grimace on his face. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got to go. You can smell that from all the way here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s pulled her pants back up and has returned to shivering outside of Kingpin.</p>

<p>Restrooms are scarce commodities on the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has got to go,&rdquo; Mike repeats. He calls the Berkeley Police (how does he have their number?) and gets an operator on the line. &ldquo;Hello? Berkeley Police? There&rsquo;s a homeless lady urinating on the streets in front of all the students&hellip; she&rsquo;s under a green blanket&hellip; middle-aged&hellip; yes I&rsquo;ll hold&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are no such things as friends on the street.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So freshman year I met this girl, Sarah. She was pretty cool, if a little quirky. I liked that. She was way in love with God. I liked that. We had shared interests and passions. Unsurprisingly, we became fast friends.</p>

<p>Time passed. Our friends thought we would get together that year. We weren&rsquo;t. Sophomore and junior years passed. We kept in touch with each other as friends. But Sarah, I figured, wasn&rsquo;t very interested in me. Which was okay because I was just fine with our friendship.</p>

<p>Senior year rolls around and wow, I start developing feelings for this amazing friend of mine. This girl is beautiful and I&rsquo;m noticing it now more than ever.</p>

<p>We have our theories why we didn&rsquo;t get together in that period of time. I think it was timing. There was a right time for our feelings to unfold. There was a right time for maturity to develop. There was a right time for us each to wrestle with our identities and fears and insecurities with Dad. There was a right time for our friendship to develop ahead of anything else.</p>

<p>Now&rsquo;s the time. Oh man, I can&rsquo;t describe to you how hopeful and scared and downright excited I am. <a href="http://www.xanga.com/plusonederful">Now I&rsquo;ll let her tell her side of the story&hellip;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s something I miss about being with my dad.</p>

<p>I have memories of just sitting in his lap waaaay back when I was a wee lad (haha). There was that security of knowing his love for me. There was that anticipation of one day growing up and being like him. Now, 15 years in the future, I think I get it.</p>

<p>My dad and I took a trip to the Big Sur coastline yesterday to hang out for the afternoon. We reminisced on how we used to take weekly family trips to the sea. &ldquo;It was really fun then,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and we could go so often; you guys didn&rsquo;t have a choice but to come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Driving Highway 1 is a little dangerous, because most drivers spend half their time looking at the expansive sea instead of the lane markers. The sea, yesterday, was particularly impressive (so I was a little nervous).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember when we went shopping for our first van?&rdquo; I ask him. I was car-crazy in the third grade. I had picked out the perfect van, a top-of-the-line Nissan Quest with all the trimmings. It was also about six thousand dollars above our budget. My dad ended up buying a bottom-of-the-line Mercury Villager with zero options, save for the air conditioning. (&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need all those options,&rdquo; he would remind me. &ldquo;You only waste money if you&rsquo;re rich&hellip; and stupid.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>My dad smiled and nodded. &ldquo;That made a big impact on me,&rdquo; I tell him. Even though my third-grade heart was crushed, he&rsquo;d taught me to differentiate between a want and a need.</p>

<p>My dad grew up poor. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t feel poor,&rdquo; he tells me, &ldquo;I was really happy.&rdquo; I grew up hearing his stories about how he used to make his own tools and toys from sticks and rubber bands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember one day my dad gave me [the Taiwanese equivalent of] 25 cents to buy candy,&rdquo; he tells me with a grin. &ldquo;That taught me grace. I got something I didn&rsquo;t deserve.&rdquo; He smiles as he remembers. &ldquo;It really made a big impact on me; I still remember it today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My grandfather is a kind man, but he wasn&rsquo;t always like that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really proud of my daddy,&rdquo; my dad tells me. &ldquo;He used to have a temper, working away in a foreign country for all those years. But as he grew older, he became kinder; he had more joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I point out how strange it is to have indirectly received a bit of Yieh Yieh through him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called a legacy,&rdquo; he tells me, and we all leave one behind.</p>

<p>Even though we grow up and we get busy, even though conversations are stilled and chances are missed, I find this time with my dad more than enough to make up for time lost.</p>

<p>We twist and turn through the highway, gaping at the coast, but never straying too far from who we are and what we leave behind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was all rather embarrassing. I was on the BART yesterday riding back from SF to Berkeley, and the riders and I couldn&rsquo;t take our eyes off this dad and his kid with bright blonde hair (who couldn&rsquo;t have been more than eight) just having a ball.</p>

<p>It was all rather sweet; the dad would wrap the kid up in his arms (to the child&rsquo;s squealing chagrin) and nuzzle him in tight. &ldquo;D Major, how about D Major?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child would struggle against his dad&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;G!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;F Sharp!&rdquo; replies the dad, &ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;re free.&rdquo; He releases the kid, who runs forward and promptly bonks his head into the opposite seat back. Then that kid would laugh for a good long while. &ldquo;F Sharp!&rdquo;  he&rsquo;d cry and collide back into his dad&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>Dad would wrap his arms tight around his boy and they&rsquo;d continue the drill. &ldquo;Mixolydian!&rdquo; the dad would say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mixolydian!&rdquo; the boy would reply and he&rsquo;d be set free, charging forward knocking himself into the seat back, beset by the giggles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paradiddle!&rdquo; the dad would cry. &ldquo;Paradiddle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud kissy noises ensued. Agh, it was too much (in a rather embarrassing, syrupy-sweet way). I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off of the sight.</p>

<p>May your families enjoy that same love in this holiday season. May you know the love (and the music) of our Father this Christmas time.</p>

<h6><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choil/">Lana Choi</a> was at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choil/sets/72157600425754607/">Suitcase Clinic</a> and snapped this photo of Mike. Psst, she&rsquo;s also an amazing <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/choil">wedding photographer</a>!</h6>

<p>Today is Mike&rsquo;s birthday. I last got a glimpse at his hospital records a month ago. If my memory serves me correctly, I spotted &ldquo;12/23/1953&rdquo; under the &ldquo;DOB&rdquo; field on the tattered Alta Bates release form. He&rsquo;ll be 54 today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of getting Mike a bunch of 10-ride passes on AC Transit. That way, on the rainy days, he won&rsquo;t have to ride his bike everywhere and get soaking wet. I&rsquo;m also thinking of getting him some simple winter-wear: gloves, a beanie and a scarf.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to invite you to bless Mike. If you&rsquo;d like to help chip in for Mike&rsquo;s birthday present, click the &ldquo;Chip In&rdquo; link in the widget below&mdash;It&rsquo;ll send you over to a PayPal page (that&rsquo;s an electronic payment processor) so we can collect the funds online. A simple donation of a couple of bucks would be awe. some. If electronic isn&rsquo;t the way to go, feel free to find me when you next see me.</p>

<p>I called Mike today and left a message on his voice mail wishing him a happy birthday and telling him we were all saying a prayer for him (please do). He called me back and left a message. You can consider it a message for you as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks for calling, man. I&rsquo;m up here in Berkeley trying to make some change. I&rsquo;ll make it through. Wish you a Merry Christmas. Love ya Drew, this is Mike.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Drew, they denied me Social Security for the second time,&rdquo; Mike told me the last time I saw him over finals week at the Asian Ghetto. He&rsquo;s holding a new cardboard sign with a hand-scrawled &ldquo;GOOD LUCK ON FINALS&rdquo; in Sharpie. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s okay, me and my lawyer, we&rsquo;ll appeal. That third time, that&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;ll let me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s been applying for Social Security disability payments, but he keeps getting rejected because, according to the rejection letters, he&rsquo;s still in signs of good health. Mike would disagree. &ldquo;My heart, Drew, my heart keep giving me pains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>True, he <em>does</em> look pretty able-bodied still, actively moving about the sidewalks and keeping in good spirits. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a job, Mike?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A group of students walk out of the Ghetto; one peels away and fumbles with his wallet, finally dropping a dollar bill into Mike&rsquo;s cup. &ldquo;Thank you, and good luck on finals,&rdquo; Mike calls out after him. The student smiles.</p>

<p>Mike turns back. &ldquo;I try,&rdquo; he tells me, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t do no heavy lifting. My last job with my brother-in-law, I had to lift and I keep getting chest pains. So I gotta apply for Social Security.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try to apply for a clerical position? Or some sort of easy job as a sales clerk or something?&rdquo; I suggest. I don&rsquo;t know why, but it seems like a dumb question.</p>

<p>He just shrugs. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t hire me.&rdquo; And I know why; it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s had a history of heart problems. Nobody wants an employee with medical liabilities.</p>

<p>But his shrugging frustrates me. Is that it? Should you just give up, Mike? Why don&rsquo;t you keep trying?</p>

<p>A man tosses change into the cup while briskly walking by. &ldquo;Good luck on finals,&rdquo; Mike calls out after him without really looking. The man turns around, and Mike does a double-take&mdash;it&rsquo;s a friend of his (obviously in middle age). &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have finals,&rdquo; Mike tells him, and they laugh it up a little.</p>

<p>Mike comes out to the Ghetto and makes consistent money shaking the cup. It&rsquo;s easier than searching for a job and getting rejected. I wonder if applying for Social Security disability is his way of avoiding the job search. Something about that doesn&rsquo;t sit right with me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll give me Social Security disability the third time around,&rdquo; Mike turns and looks at me with a hopeful grin. &ldquo;My lawyer tells me that&rsquo;s how it works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decide to let this drop for now. We clasp hands and say a prayer. Then I have to go study and we say goodbye.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And inevitably you&rsquo;ll find yourself diving through those piles, rummaging through the receipts and trinkets, kicking yourself for tossing out that <em>one</em> card or photo or envelope you know you must keep. You have a vague notion as to why it&rsquo;s important, but it hasn&rsquo;t occurred to you yet.</p>

<p>We are rash, we fear loss; we are superhuman, we crave the warmth of memory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Then throw it all into piles and funnel them into boxes. You don&rsquo;t need that trinket and Lord knows when the last time you took a look at that photograph. Some of these people don&rsquo;t even know you anymore. Should you keep or should you toss? Come on homie, who are you kidding, you should have gotten rid of that years ago. Tear those posters off the walls; you&rsquo;ve outlived those. That&rsquo;s not you anymore. There&rsquo;s a reason time only moves forward and takes you along with it.</p>

<p>Donate the rest of the stuff to the library. Pack it off to the dumpster. Nobody needs it. We need to stay organized. We need that extra space. All that clutter is suffocating. Repeat it after me. Suff&mdash;o&mdash;ca&mdash;ting.</p>

<p>Trust us, you&rsquo;ll work better this way. You won&rsquo;t feel so distracted. You don&rsquo;t want this stuff around anymore&mdash;what makes you think anybody else does?</p>

<p>Have you had your time to reminisce? Good, now move on. Life doesn&rsquo;t wait for you, neither should you for it.</p>
