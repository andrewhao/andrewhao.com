  <div class="entry-content"><p>San Francisco wraps me up with hot pumice breath and does not let go. She follows me with a sincerity that I cannot shake, offering the fruits of her cacophony as the throaty rumbling of cable cars, as the muted quarreling of European travelers, blue eyed children in tow, as azalea sunbursts lining the steps I jog each afternoon. She orchestrates the movements of ten thousand bicyclists. She punctuates the skies with glass ornaments and fighter-jet jewels. and lures in her prey with the offerings of raven gold parlayed over her streets. She charms me over then just as quickly, she turns</p>

<p>cold; suddenly I am colored frigid by blasts of air conditioning from cavernous parking garages, blown to and fro through alleyways. Her eyes darken by murky sea gales, and nighttime cools her zeal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I miss running barefoot &mdash; there was something about running with the spring in your step, pushing gingerly against the grass, feeling the strength of the stride move through your legs and through your toes that made you feel powerful, or free, or wild. When I first started early on, I always felt sore and achy at the bottom of my foot, like pinpricks lived there. We&rsquo;d joke that running the lake barefoot was safe&mdash;so long as you didn&rsquo;t step on the needles. A few times I felt a sharp pain and swore I did step on one&hellip; only to find out that I was fine. But as the calluses built, your stride adjusted and you would feel safer, and the stones wouldn&rsquo;t cut you anymore and you&rsquo;d run a little faster, leaning into the slicing chill, ignoring the numbness of running on wet grass on the north end of the lake and run home in darkness against the dotted glow of Lake Merritt&rsquo;s necklace.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had the thought where I wished I could have been more wild when I was younger. Maybe it&rsquo;d be kind of cool to grow up and live in some remote town in the forest. I&rsquo;d like to run freely in the dirt and swim in a few lakes. I would have liked to learn how to wrestle and gotten in fights and build forts and bruise a few more knees and kiss a few more girls. I&rsquo;d like to have known the strength in my back and courage in my heart.  I remember always being fascinated with the protagonist in <em>My Side of the Mountain</em> &mdash; the idea of this boy living in the woods fending for himself, scavenging berries and tanning leather and hunting for venison (and tending to his own pet <em>falcon</em> &mdash; now that was frickin cool).</p>

<p>A memory circa 1998: my family is skiing at Yosemite and I&rsquo;m tired. I ask my Dad if I can go back by myself &mdash; the shuttle bus will be an hour ride down to the Valley floor. I must have been twelve, max. It is snowing heavily. He hands me the keys tells me to go ahead, and I make that ride back down myself. That day I feel like I&rsquo;ve crossed a threshold.</p>

<p>These days there are places in my life where I can say &mdash; I&rsquo;m going to be wild. <em>I&rsquo;m going to fight for this</em>, or <em>I&rsquo;m going to figure this out</em>. I&rsquo;m going to do this because as a grown man, I still want to run, and explore, and give it a good try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the end of last month, Nate, Bruce and I did the <a href="http://trifreaks.com/golden-gate-triathlon/">Golden Gate Triathlon</a> together. This was only my second triathlon ever (after last year&rsquo;s <a href="http://onyourmarkevents.com/TriForFuninfo.htm">Tri for Fun</a>), and I intended to train hard for this sucker.</p>

<p>Given my plantar fasciitis, this was slow going. Fortunately, this gave me a lot of opportunities to focus on bike and swim: long bike rides with the Regen cycling crew, open water swims with Nate in Alameda and Jeff every week in the DeFremery and Lions pools.</p>

<p>The course was: 0.93 mile loop a little off the Crissy Field beach. Then an epic 25 mile bike ride up and down from the Crissy Field Warming Hut lot, up over the Golden Gate Bridge parking lot entrance and down Lincoln (past an __epic view of the coast) and then back &mdash; six times. Finally, a 6 mile run out and back over the Golden Gate Bridge. It goes without saying that the views were generally epic.</p>

<h2>Swim</h2>

<p>We huddled up by the beach and listened to the race director describe the course. Two loops around three buoys.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576017804/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7576017804_d7abb3047d.jpg" alt="Prepping for the swim" /></a> This photographer knew what s/he was doing.[/caption]</p>

<p>Wetsuit: I got a month rental at Sports Basement in early June. That sucker chafed at my neck a LOT. Remember next time to Body Glide it up. I was surprised at how buoyant the suit was. I also need to work on my swim technique. I pop up too often to look, when I could keep my head down and do a few more strokes before I take another look.</p>

<p>The plot got interesting when we saw the first wave of women jump into the water and start their wave. Within seconds, they started drifting sideways &mdash; <em>really</em> drifting &mdash; and fighting the current. I thought nothing about it, figuring that&rsquo;s just how it is when you swim open water.</p>

<p>But no, when I got in it was frickin <em>tough</em>. I rounded the first buoy, keeping up at the end of the pack when we turned the corner and bam. Treadmill status. I paddled for what I thought was ten minutes, and noticed that I had basically moved 10 feet. <em>What?</em></p>

<p>So I panicked a little. And then had to calm myself down by reminding myself two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> You won&rsquo;t drown.</p></li>
<li><p> You&rsquo;re strong enough</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I figured I needed to swim harder and started to kick a bit more and kind of mentally prepared myself to dig in and be swimming for an hour or so. But by then I had fallen <em>really</em> far behind (I&rsquo;m not that strong of a swimmer) and I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out the target buoy in the distance because I was staring into the sun.</p>

<p>Then another swimmer grabbed me and yelled for me to go back to shore. &ldquo;They cancelled the swim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I really just felt relief. Upon hitting shore folks were kind of in a daze, confused. Some were sprinting for the T1 station, so I kind of jogged on over. The tri had just become a duathlon.</p>

<p>I checked my watch and realized I had been in the water for 32 minutes and hadn&rsquo;t even made it halfway around the first lap. So good thing they cancelled the swim. I woulda been out there for a <em>long</em> time.</p>

<p>I had a horrible T1. I figured before the race I was just gonna strip the wetsuit and throw on my bike jersey. No way. Skin&rsquo;s too wet. I fought with my jersey for a couple of minutes as Bruce and Nate blew on past me. Ugh. Finally I got my jersey on and I was on my way.</p>

<h2>Bike</h2>

<p>I figured I was an okay biker, but I had made a mistake and gone on a workout the morning prior to race day. I&rsquo;d normally never do this on race day, but I figured somehow that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>But the course hurt a <em>lot</em> more than I&rsquo;d anticipated. If you weren&rsquo;t zooming down a hill, you were climbing one. There were next to no flats. And it was a bit mentally taxing keeping a count of the lap you were doing in your head. I half expected to either ride one too little or one too many laps.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576018872/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8285/7576018872_c8f37cf8e5.jpg" alt="Bike descent" /></a></p>

<p>It was kind of fun riding a loop course though. And the view down Lincoln was epic as usual. Every time I&rsquo;d pass Nate going opposite directions I&rsquo;d give him a little grunt of encouragement. Next time I&rsquo;m gonna have to catch him so I can ride with him.</p>

<p>I finished the bike ride at 1:43:14.</p>

<p>25 miles later we hit T2 and I threw on my shoes and was outta there&hellip;</p>

<h2>Run</h2>

<p>I was both the most confident and the most shaky about the run. Running&rsquo;s my strength, and I knew I could crank out a 10K pretty well. But I hadn&rsquo;t run over 4 miles on a workout in months. I&rsquo;d have to trust my general cardio training on the bike to sustain me for the run.</p>

<p>We looped Crissy Field and headed up to the bridge. I didn&rsquo;t feel as much quad burn as I noticed after my first tri. I actually stopped to use the john halfway up&hellip; I drank too much on the bike!</p>

<p>I felt great on the steps going up &mdash; taking them two at a time and generally feeling springy. We hit the bridge and it became a game of catch-the-next-guy and dodge-the-tourists. There was a lot of dodging (and I nearly had a couple of close calls with unwary tourists). I felt really good dropping runners though.</p>

<p>One crazy thing happened &mdash; the runners went through a low tunnel on the way up. The girl running ahead of me smacked her head on the top of the tunnel and flew backwards and landed on her back. We stopped and grabbed medical help for her &mdash; there was a good amount of blood and it could have been bad. She was conscious though and able to talk through it though. Scary.</p>

<p>I finished the run in 43:46. Which is 7:04/mi pace, including a pee break and a quick detour to grab a course volunteer. Awesome.</p>

<h2>End</h2>

<p>I finished with an overall time of 2:28:20, placing me 10th in the race and 2nd in the Male 30-39 division (sweet! Also: they had registered me at 36 years old :D). Nate edged me out by 39 seconds at 2:27:41, and Bruce finished with a respectable 2:58.</p>

<p>Afterwards we enjoyed the postrace glow with a lot of peanut butter jelly sandwiches (glory!). And Clif bars. Then I found a cafe and had a big mocha. And took a fat nap.</p>

<p>Sweet! So I&rsquo;ve still not technically finished an Olympic-distance race, but maybe that&rsquo;ll be next time. All in all, I&rsquo;m happy with my performance, especially on the run.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I&rsquo;m not afraid of dying</em>. I&rsquo;m surprised by the thought flitting across my mind as my plane takes off. Were we to plunge into the California coast as the scene used to play out in my imagination, I&rsquo;d be ready for that.</p>

<p>I had a backwards-sort of feeling tonight as I entered the airport, breezing through the security lines and arriving at my gate much too early. Justin and Frank had dropped me off and gone to In &lsquo;n Out without me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going home to Pasadena. Or rather, I&rsquo;m going to see my family in Pasadena, with Annie&rsquo;s graduation being the reason for celebration. Going home means something different these days. Is it the house you grew up in? Is about seeing your family, your friends? Is it neon-lit boba shops, or the wideness of De Anza Boulevard or Calabasas Park with the ghost stories or the panicky feeling of waking up realizing you&rsquo;ve overslept first period or junior or senior prom from howlongago&mdash; and the exhilaration of pulling off a spectacular field show or the happy sensation of rolling up to a full dining table exploding with Taiwanese foods? Yes, yes, and yes.</p>

<p>I have a memory where I am dropping off my parents at SFO. They are leaving for China, my sisters are still undergrads in San Diego. I am seeing Sarah at the time; she stands to my left as we wave our good-byes to them from across the glassed security walls. And that&rsquo;s when it hits, a sudden blue-ness, a feeling of being gone, or that finally, I am on my own. I wonder if that&rsquo;s what it feels like to be grown-up. All the older folks in Stephen Ministry tell about loved ones passing away, spouses divorcing, buddies moving across the country for a job, or spouse, or to take care of a relative. It&rsquo;s a fact (it&rsquo;s so true that you may surprise yourself because you don&rsquo;t understand it yet), the people you grow to treasure and love will leave you, and that leaving-ness is a sensation that startled me that day. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just as true that I was unique in experiencing it so late in my life.</p>

<p>In that memory, we duck in to the Sharper Image store to play with the massage chairs. The rollers playfully tug and push and pull at my calves and lower back, and I stare hard at the remote, squirming, barely making out the buttons, fighting back stupid tears. Hold it together man. C&#8217;mon, I&rsquo;m self-talking. Pull yourself together.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s a backward feeling because tonight I&rsquo;m flying home to my family. I am excited to see everybody again. I&rsquo;m proud of my sister. I&rsquo;m glad to get out of Oakland. I&rsquo;m feeling a bit more courageous. It merely took time.</p>

<p>Later on the plane, I&rsquo;m dozing off when another memory startles me: Shortly after my dad gave me my first computer somewhere in the fifth grade, I convinced my mom to buy me a word processor to install on it. I was a bookish kid then (thankfully!), and always had my nose buried in a novel. I had just finished reading some Crichton book&mdash;<em>Airframe</em> I believe&mdash;and wrote a story basically verbatim from the book about a plane crashing in the Pacific. In it, I describe in painstaking detail the panic of the passengers, the luggage flying about the compartment, the sound the latches made when they flipped open, what exactly the pilot would say into the intercom&hellip; which was whatever Mr. Crichton would have said in his novel. I titled the piece <em>The Final Flight of Flight 738</em> or something equally dramatic to an eleven-year-old. But the most clear part of the memory was when my dad saw that I was writing something that Saturday morning: I saw a blend of curiosity and pride light up his face. &ldquo;Here. Let me see it,&rdquo; he had said, moving toward me, reaching for the printout in my hands.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I can run!</em> I&rsquo;m on a jog on my lunch break for the first time in four months, and I want to tell it to everyone: tourists with itchy, sunstroked faces crowding Chinatown, Dan, down-cast on the street corner in front of that handmade sushi roll place, forty-something yuppies with yoga mats yelping as I dodge them by. I&rsquo;m drinking it in, the clangs of cable-car bells, the way they fade off when the car heads up the hill on California, the way the riders have a faraway look as if they&rsquo;ve seen something familiar yet mysterious (maybe it&rsquo;s warm nostalgia for things they can&rsquo;t remember).</p>

<p>Everything is beautiful: the way the buttery spires on Saints Peter &amp; Paul church melt into the sky. The easy spring in my stride, which surprises me. The pleasant shade of laurel trees on Jackson, set against Telegraph Hill. I have to hold myself back from racing other runners down the Embarcadero because I&rsquo;m liable to hurt myself again. But I race them anyways. <em>I can run! </em>I sing a song in my head; it is a simple one for which I&rsquo;ve forgotten the verse but not the refrain: <em>he who began a good work in you / will be faithful to complete it</em>. And so it goes.</p>

<p>Four miles in, I lope to the center of the divide in front of the Ferry Building and stretch below the sculpture in its center, noticing a small twinge in my heel. Easy now, I tell myself. Don&rsquo;t let it get to your head. But the endorphins take over and I feel light again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Through your own merciful dealings with me, O Lord my God, tell me what you are to me. Say to my soul, I am your salvation. Say it so that I can hear it. My heart is listening, Lord; open the ears of my heart and say to my soul, I am your salvation. Let me run towards this voice and seize hold of you. Do not hide your face from me: let me die so that I may see it, for not to see it would be death to me indeed.</p>

<p>— St. Augustine, <em>Confessions</em></p>

<p>What I love is that Augustine asks God to move toward him &mdash; <em>Say to my soul, I am your salvation</em>. I&rsquo;m listening, he says, but I need you to speak it to me so it resonates with my soul.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel like seasons are changing, not just in the air but through my life. I&rsquo;m outdoors more often, laughing more, more <em>okay</em> with things being stuck, or in-between, or just not formed yet.</p>

<p>The plantar fasciitis is still there, and not being able to run has been frustrating to say the least, but I&rsquo;ve been enjoying bike rides and swims. Summer is in the air, and a part of me is stretching and yawning and settling in to it. One of my favorite feelings is being at home with friends on a warm evening with the windows open, full after a shared meal, listening to a George Strait song and chatting about whatever. Those nights I go to bed and think to myself, <em>I&rsquo;m happy. God is good. I have been given much.</em></p>

<p>I thought the same thing about my family&hellip; we Skyped for a bit last week and I wonder why I&rsquo;m not more in touch with them more often when there&rsquo;s clearly a lot of love between us. I have been given much. And this is kind of awkward because they all read this blog (hi Mom!).</p>
