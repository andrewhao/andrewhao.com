  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Come Yilmaz, up yourself and let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His companion&rsquo;s voice tugged at him from beyond the ether, and as such he slogged to break through his mind&rsquo;s haze and drag an eyelid open. Days of travel through the treacherous Kaçkars had worn them through, and his companion&rsquo;s ragged appearance was suddenly new to him again, like a dog or a beggar. Yilmaz tried to stifle a laugh (unsuccessfully) to the chagrin of his companion.</p>

<p>To his knees he half-rolled, half-crawled, his bones murmuring their complaints. He remembered the first time he had realized he was old: his son Asil had knocked him over in a playful attempt to wrestle him to the ground. Yilmaz had his back turned, and hadn&rsquo;t been prepared for the full onslaught of the 12-year old. With the breath knocked halfway out of his lungs, he was surprised at the sinewy strength in his son&rsquo;s arms. Though wiry, the boy possessed a strength of a man whose life work was in his hands. He had already begun to talk about going into town to go to secondary school, an idea Yilmaz had resisted at first without knowing why.</p>

<p>Ayla had reassured him that the boy was dreaming the right things; his wife was usually right. School would be right for Asil, who needed to be among children his age. She rarely made much of a fuss about anything, but her insistence about Asil&rsquo;s schooling had caught him off-guard. They had danced around the subject for days, but her reasoning, motherly wisdom and effervescent charm began to win him over.</p>

<p>She held him in the years he lay in confinement. He&rsquo;d often awaken to the sensation of tendrils of warmth, fast-fading, brushed against his back and chest. Under the evergreen canopy he walks to her where she takes his weathered hands in hers. Lightly kissing her forehead, he inhales the dewy fragrance of her hair long enough to steal it away for the morning ahead. She continues to anchor Asil firmly to the earth with slender, wise hands.</p>

<p>A thunderclap of pain pushed Yilmaz to his knees, and with a horse&rsquo;s determination and much moaning, he straightened up. The setting sun glimmered off the distant outline of the Black Sea with the day&rsquo;s last portion of light. The guards and their search dogs would never find them here.</p>

<p>When Yilmaz lay in his cell, he&rsquo;d often dream of a moment such as this: the torches would be blazing long after dark, welcoming him home. He&rsquo;d round the corner to be greeted by the cries of his boy and the warmth of his beloved and the scent of evergreens. The door would be open, stuck in the gravel, and upon entering his home he would be received with the laughter of friends, the sighs of relief, and an overwhelming desire to crumple to the floor and bawl and kick and moan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/2072718597/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2121/2072718597_7c8ecd7802.jpg" alt="Channing Ave, 11PM." /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m awakened in the morning by a phone call &mdash; It&rsquo;s Mr. Smith, and his car needs a jump. The evening before we had spotted him in the parking lot; he was still seated in his parked car, eyes closed in rapt concentration or heavy sleep, we couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jazz,&rdquo; he explains later. He listens to the jazz giants in his car as is his tradition upon returning home from church. He is aging, his frame is small and hunched, he is becoming forgetful. His car is often parked askew between the lot lines, drifting at odd angles, curious flotsam in an asphalt sea.</p>

<p>Years ago, Miles, John and Dizzy serenade Mr. and Mrs. Smith as they sit together in the driver and passenger seats, holding hands all the way back from church on 98th Ave. There they float and unwind, recounting the events of that evening&rsquo;s ministry. I imagine she smiles at the way his pageboy hat carries at a rakish angle, the way he recites the benediction with the voice of a man much younger than his years. And now I imagine him still sitting in that parking lot, recounting his evening with her, murmuring and chuckling in a half-conscious reverie.</p>

<p>Kind of blue, Mr. Smith drifts to where his beloved still lives, who leans over to playfully adjust his bow tie, takes his wrinkled hands into hers and lets him feel her beating chest where the cancer has not yet gone. There he stays with her, hearing the music well into the morning when the instrument panel will dim, the frost will clamber onto the hood and the chill will irritate his throat and cause him to cough a couple of times. Slow, measured coughs. He turns over in his seat.</p>

<p>I run into the morning chill and see his car is running with the help of a friendly neighbor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a new battery,&rdquo; he tells me, fumbling with the jumper cables. With bright, certain eyes he declares, &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The longer I spend around a church, the more I see that people are really, really broken. And that&rsquo;s really good for me to see, because I&rsquo;m starting to grasp how deep the Father-love really is, and how unconditional it is. Loud are the songs of broken sinners.</p>

<p>Henri Nouwen is teaching me to stare loneliness in the face and accept it, to allow it to teach me to &ldquo;live rather than just survive&rdquo; and direct me to the Father. It&rsquo;s hard, because I have problems trusting that I will be unconditionally loved in a human way. Can I believe that?</p>

<p>It occurred to me last Sunday that communion is the one place where Father-love is tangible. The memory of the cross becomes tactile in the bread and the wine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really admire <a href="http://my.opera.com/nosabe332/blog/">Eric</a>&rsquo;s patience with people. After Evangelism class he spent an hour and a half with a wheelchair-bound Betty Dunn, doing genealogy searches with her and looking at photos on Flickr. I normally don&rsquo;t have any patience with people like Betty, because I want to send her home as soon as possible so I can get the things done in my schedule that I need to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just tell myself that I&rsquo;ve got nothing better to do with my time [than spend it with Betty]&rdquo; Eric says.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like what it&rsquo;s like in genuine relationships, huh? That nothing is more important to you than spending time with them right there. I got really convicted of that. My personal tendency is to overschedule things and then shove people into these boxes. But real love knows that people take time. People have dreams, random thoughts, fears, and desires. I&rsquo;m learning about real love.</p>

<p>Another thing I&rsquo;m learning came through a <a href="http://sermons2.redeemer.com/sermons/praying-spirit">Tim Keller sermon</a> <a href="http://themarrow.wordpress.com">Justin</a> sent me about prayer:</p>

<p>For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; (Romans 8:15)</p>

<p>TK was saying how &ldquo;Abba&rdquo; is less &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; than &ldquo;Da-da&rdquo;, that it&rsquo;s a cry that we all know from birth, a primal, instinctual cry for our Father&rsquo;s help and support. And another thing TK points out is that we <em>cry;</em> we don&rsquo;t state, or request, or merely say. It&rsquo;s weirdly comforting knowing that life is supposed to come with pain, that even the strongest and wisest go through depression, that there&rsquo;s no happy-clappy remedies except to endure and to hope and persevere when all we know how to say is <em>Dad&hellip; help</em>. Following Jesus isn&rsquo;t supposed to be easy, but our Dad is really a Good dad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found myself drawn to grids mostly because they were manageable. You can write your way out of one as soon as easily as you write your way in. Grids are safe, incubators for words and ideas to sit, like plastic-wrapped photo frames, or little cardboard boxes filled with styrofoam peanuts, keeping the hallowed words from the dangers of the outside.</p>

<p>I poured my words into these grids, and everything was fantastic at first. I felt like I was writing with so much more clarity. The vertical bars stopped each word from running into the next, and the horizontal shelves held sturdy. Things were intricate, precise, and beautiful &mdash; mathematically so.</p>

<p>Until they began falling out. The more I tried to place, the more would begin to fall. Lines wavered, words waffled, sentences wilted, melted, forming ink puddles at my feet. oh no, stop it i said, my precious words but i could not keep them from crashing through each other and shattering as they hit the floor and in my frustration i wanted to sweep them, words, grids and all in my arms and toss them all out as a child does  &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Autumn is blazing in San Francisco; its fiery oaks defy the growing chill. I am biking the Wiggle, the well-known route from Market St to Golden Gate Park that all cyclists here know. It is the kind of route that is knowingly passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition; the route is now marked by street signs, garishly set to large print to guide clumsy bike-riding tourists to their destinations. Right-left-right-left-right-left&mdash;I slam on the brakes&mdash;a Muni bus nearly clips me as it makes a right turn.</p>

<p>San Francisco is a city I love and a city that, now that I&rsquo;m no longer there, lives adjacent to that space in my head reserved for nostalgia. As such: the scent of dewy redwood groves, the family vacation to Big Sur when we were all crammed in the minivan and Dad couldn&rsquo;t find that one hotel so we drove for hours until we ended up turning around and driving all night back home and I lay half-sleeping in the front seat listening to him sing to himself, the fearful arrangement of piano keys, that long walk to class with Lesley (my elementary-school crush, the one with the silken hair), looking up at dark clouds and smelling the dampness of impending rain.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the kind of morning that slaps you with its chill, but seduces you by warming your extremities with gentle sunshine and crisp air. Children are clamoring over the steps of the Conservatory garden, some settling in groups of twos and threes content to gossip over television shows and pop stars. Others run over the lawn, drinking red hickory air. Parents, their faces belying exhaustion, labor to bring out school-boxed lunches. A pair of blue-eyed girls, mischievous as they come, grab an unsuspecting boy&rsquo;s hat and toss it down a hill.</p>

<p>He gets up, his face registering confusion. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; A hesitant half-smile grows on his face. &#8221;Where did you put it?&ldquo; I look closer; he clasps his hands in the awkward fashion that little boys do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to run down and get it!&rdquo; they twitter. He turns, visibly dejected, and slowly pads down the hill. I imagine him picking up the hat (a shy smile lengthening to span his cheeks, a laugh hiding in its corners) and taking off, running.</p>

<p>I can feel chimney-smoke envelop me and my memory churns: Was I too fearful to look Lesley in the eye?&mdash;the Number of Bay Area Bike Fatalities has Increased Twenty-Three Percent over the Past Decade. Fell-Scott-Haight-Pierce-Waller-Steiner-Duboce (For-Sure-Hannah-Played-With-Sand-Dunes)&mdash;Dad and I got home at 2AM that night (but what was it about Lesley?). I remember feeling the rough-hewn edges of my dad&rsquo;s five o&#8217;clock shadow, wishing for his strength. The Wiggle was carved by years and years of rushing water; the Conservatory is made of tooth-picks.</p>

<p>Autumn is summer&rsquo;s swan song; a bridge one crosses once youth is spent. It never arrives, only passes, lodging itself beneath the consciousness. Later that day, dodging buses, I let out a gasp. The air is nippy. I am that boy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(While chatting about Israel&rsquo;s skinny jeans).</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like skinny jeans, they&rsquo;re too tight for me. Or maybe my legs are fat.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Being assertive is really unnatural for me. Eric called me out on this the other day:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does anybody want to drive?&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really tired because I&rsquo;ve driven a lot today. Can somebody else drive for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It never even CROSSED my mind that I could say &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m tired and I don&rsquo;t want to do this.&rdquo; Passive-aggressive kids can be pretty messed up. But at least I&rsquo;m figuring this out now rather than later. Shout-out to Eric for calling it out. There&rsquo;s hope!</p>
