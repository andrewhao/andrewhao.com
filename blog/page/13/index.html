<p>Justin hands me a photo a few weeks ago. Can you get this blown up? Mike wants it.</p>

<p>I go see Mike. What do you want it to say?</p>

<p>He thinks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rest in peace, Godfather. From your brother, Spicy Mike.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sunday, I get a call from Mike. &ldquo;Hey Drew, listen I gotta talk to you man,&rdquo; he starts. But this time, his voice is different: wearier, on eggshells.Â &#8221;I&rsquo;m at Alta Bates right now. My brother Wayne&rsquo;s in the hospital. He&rsquo;s on his way out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God. What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got an infection, and it&rsquo;s been bad Drew, it&rsquo;s been bad.&rdquo; I hear some muffled voices in the background. &ldquo;But hey Drew, I gotta go now. I need your prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Truth of the matter is that when I graduated and moved away, I lost touch with Mike. It wasn&rsquo;t a sudden break, but gradual and subtle. I graduated. I went to Africa. I came back and started working. Mike stayed around.</p>

<p>Every once in awhile, I get a phone call from him. &ldquo;Hey Drew, how ya doin?&rdquo; Mike will ask. And I will tell him that I&rsquo;m at work, and I&rsquo;ll call him back. I try to remember to call him back. I really do.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mike, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He passed at 7:07.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wayne just gave up man. Drew, I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can say nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t cry no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Sarah and I show up at Alta Bates later that evening with some coffee and La Burrita. We wait for Mike in the waiting room. Soon he comes in a bit unsteadily, a boombox clutched in one hand, a thick wool beanie covering his head and ears. Slumping into the seat across from us, he leans forward and puts his head in his hands. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone&rdquo;&mdash;and exhales.</p>

<p>The details make their way out. &ldquo;I was out in Berkeley doing my thang. They had to come find me, tell me &lsquo;Mike, your brother Wayne&rsquo;s in the hospital. You gotta get over now.&rsquo; Can you believe that? They had to come find me.</p>

<p>Sarah offers Mike some coffee. Mike looks up and over&mdash;you brought that? Bless you. A deep sip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wayne had an infection&rdquo;&mdash;Mike says the name of some medical term, but I can&rsquo;t quite catch it. &ldquo;There was an infection on his insides. He was in so much pain. They say he couldn&rsquo;t hear nobody, but I was there at his side talking to him and I know he can hear me. You know? He twitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gotta tell everyone on his street that he gone now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike chuckles a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, I tell you, Wayne used to always walk by this woman&rsquo;s house in the morning. She used to ask me, &lsquo;Why does Wayne always do that?&rsquo; I say &lsquo;It&rsquo;s because he likes you!&rsquo; She says &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m married!&rsquo; and I say &lsquo;Well that&rsquo;s why Wayne always coming around when your man&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mike laughs as he relives the memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was prepared for Moms, but nothing prepared me for Wayne, you know? You&rsquo;re ready to see your momma pass, but not your own brother. Drew, I can&rsquo;t cry no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Last I heard from Mike, he was about to go in to court for his Social Security hearing. &ldquo;You gonna come, Drew?&rdquo; he asked me. I told him I&rsquo;d be there, and just to give him a call. &ldquo;Good. I just need you to say to the judge that you seen me have heart problems and take me to the hospital once.&rdquo; I tell him to have his lawyer call me. She never does.</p>

<p>Mike called the afternoon before his court date. I&rsquo;m at work, so I let the call go straight to voice mail. &ldquo;Hey Drew, it&rsquo;s Mike. Court hearing&rsquo;s tomorrow. Can you come?&rdquo; I call him right back, but alas, it&rsquo;s disconnected. All through the evening and into the next day, his number&rsquo;s still disconnected, and I wonder how his case turns out.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God got his purpose, Drew. I know that. Last night I was walking the neighborhood and I saw this shooting star. Just&hellip; <em>shoom</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Mike makes this flying hand motion&mdash;&ldquo;I saw a shooting star and it fly right over Wayne&rsquo;s house. And I knew, I just knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wayne was a grumpy guy, you know? Every time I come over he kick me right out after fifteen minutes. Say he don&rsquo;t want to see nobody. He was a hard man, but he was family ya know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s expression changes, and he puts his head down in his hands again. &ldquo;When my Moms passed, we all came together again. That was her last wish. We usually fighting and everything and sure enough, we came together. But we was fighting all over her things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My big sister give me a call one day and she says &lsquo;Mike, come down here and take some of Mom&rsquo;s stuff.&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want nothing to do with it.&rsquo; Everybody&rsquo;s over there taking and taking. I finally go down and you know what&rsquo;s left? A vacuum cleaner.&rdquo; Mike&rsquo;s face registers disgust. &ldquo;They take everything but her vacuum cleaner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sarah and I don&rsquo;t know what to say, but to look intently at him.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from Mike time and time again. He&rsquo;ll call me once in awhile and leave a voice mail message. &ldquo;Hey Drew, just thinking of you. Call me back all right? Say hi to Sarah for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t deserve a friend like Mike,&rdquo; Sarah told me last night. &ldquo;You know? Like we&rsquo;re not nearly as good as friends to him as he is to us. He has every right to disregard us as do-gooder students, but we really are his friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I try to remember to call, I swear I do.</p>

<p>Since Mike doesn&rsquo;t have a working cell phone any more, he calls me from several phone numbers, all of which I judge to be his family. One number is his sister&rsquo;s, another is Belinda&rsquo;s. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; I ask Belinda. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not doing too well,&rdquo; she replies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you talk to him?&rdquo; his sister asks, her voice cracking too, &ldquo;He really needs someone to talk to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>I met Mike on a starry evening five years ago on Telegraph and Durant. Was it March, or was it April? He was sitting on a milk carton at the time; I was a big-eyed freshman willing to talk to anybody. I met a Mike who was lost in his thoughts. &ldquo;You know what man,&rdquo; he tells me that evening, &ldquo;I miss my Moms. She passed five years ago today.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s a strange life, this is. I&rsquo;m standing at the Caltrain station, watching the 195 leave me behind in the dust, watching a long, slow whistle escape from the engine train and surround me with its delightful irony. Tonight I&rsquo;ll get home an hour later, maybe by 1AM if I&rsquo;m lucky.</p>

<p>I wobble off my bike, sweaty and more than a little frustrated, and stumble over to the nearest bench. There&rsquo;s nobody to curse but steel, diesel, and a heartless timetable. I kick a cockroach; it rolls over and scurries away. Hrmph. Still grumpy. Okay, I&rsquo;ll vent on Twitter. Bad idea Andrew, broadcasting angst over the Internet is a cultural faux pas (but look at what you&rsquo;re reading, ha!).</p>

<p>Life is just <em>really different</em>. I just realized why&mdash;it&rsquo;s become much harder to attach meaning to things anymore. I wake up, I catch the J bus, I walk into work, I fix bugs, draw mockups, code features, grab lunch, take a run, catch the bus, go home, watch a movie&hellip; and do it all over again. Life&rsquo;s more routine. My identity suddenly doesn&rsquo;t feel as much a small-group leader, or a mentor, or a student, or a friend, or a musician any more as it is mostly now as a&hellip; what?</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a warm summer evening here at the Caltrain station. I sit here for an hour and take in the rhododendron breeze. Forced to stay, and sit, and watch, and be.</p>

<p>A blind man slowly teeters up to the fare booth and orders a ticket. &ldquo;WELCOME TO CALTRAIN!&rdquo; the lady with the digital voice blares, and the blind man, startled, silences her with the powers of Braille. A cockroach scurries underfoot and heads for the light.</p>

<p>I close my eyes and listen to the rhythms of the city: the groanings of the train tracks, the soft rush of traffic, people conversing faintly just over the other side.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about how hard life is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a rough month for everyone. Folks suffering through cancer, layoffs, relationship losses, and passings in the family. Stories of confusion, backstabbing, heartbreak, and confusion are bubbling up right and left. What do we do in this despair?</p>

<p>The wife of my old pastor was recently diagnosed with Stage IV lymphoma. It crept up on her, silently and suddenly. Reading emails my pastor sent, I was struck by how raw the feelings of fear, loss, and pain were.</p>

<p>But far over it all was a tone of resilience. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve called this theme of this season of our lives &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your cancer&rsquo;&rdquo; I hear how determined they are to face this silent killer with faith and continue running this race with endurance.</p>

<p>This has been a bit of a rough patch for myself as well. I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to describe it.</p>

<p>Yesterday at small group we were talking about Jesus and his suffering on earth and on the cross. How in the end, we can endure great suffering because we hope in the eternal (the things unseen) and, powerful and reassuring to me, that Jesus himself endured our suffering. He knows exactly what it&rsquo;s like.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your cancer. What&rsquo;s it like to hope instead of being paralyzed by fear?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your suffering. What&rsquo;s it like to look beyond ourselves to others and Jesus instead of descending into a pit of despair?</p>

<p>I want to know this. To hope, to rejoice, to continue on the Mission. We may not know it now, but we know it nonetheless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&rsquo;m cutting my hair on Sunday&mdash;no big deal, right? I&rsquo;ve been cutting my hair for the past eleven years (one mirror, one trimmer and nerves of steel) to varying degrees of success. Well&hellip; my standard of success means that after my haircut, I should a) still be recognizable as me and b) not elicit laughter (a compliment here and there wouldn&rsquo;t be bad, either!).</p>

<p>Sunday, I gave myself a pretty bad haircut. It was a really hot evening, and I was impatient to be finished. Well, buzzing trimmer in hand (with no guard), I misjudged the angle of my head and on my way up, and&hellip; <em>whoops!</em></p>

<p>In one fell swoop, I had a crater on the back of my head. Further inspection with a mirror revealed the horrifying truth: It was bad; I could give the ozone layer a run for its money. And really, all I could really do was laugh.</p>

<p>I think this was the icing on the cake to a long trial period in my life where I&rsquo;ve just realized how uncool and incompetent I am. I&rsquo;m not very suave. The words that come out of my mouth can be Shockingly Dumb. I can be forgetful, I can be insecure, I can be totally, totally awkward. I&rsquo;m a Neanderthal.</p>

<p>In short, I can fail in more ways than I ever thought I could, and I&rsquo;m not as well put together as I thought I was, and that&rsquo;s been super depressing to come to grips with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been learning the hard lessons of who I really am. I&rsquo;ve had my pride knocked around a <em>lot</em>. Between myself and Sarah, I&rsquo;ve discovered that I&rsquo;m a Total Idiot when it comes to emotions and communication and all that good stuff (who can relate?!).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made mistakes at work. I&rsquo;ve been a bad friend. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of things that just weren&rsquo;t up to par. I&rsquo;m actually not as good of a guy than I gave myself credit for.</p>

<p>But, maybe that&rsquo;s what leads to the laughing. Maybe this is just it; maybe I&rsquo;m going through the wringer to get humbled and get a fresh beginning on this post-college life. Maybe this is exactly what it feels like to know how much I need Grace, and to be at my wits&#8217; end regarding my own abilities to accomplish anything Good. And maybe there&rsquo;s that joy that&hellip; heck. Crater or no crater, I&rsquo;m loved. I&rsquo;m not that big of a deal, and that&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>

<p>I know I need God. Dang. That&rsquo;s the one thing that echoes through my mind every morning. I can&rsquo;t make it through the day without your Grace, Jesus. I don&rsquo;t care about anything else.</p>

<p>A verse, ever-quoted through this blog, is James 1:2-5. The words stumble through my lips by losers and failures like me, making them all the more powerful.</p>

<blockquote><p>2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p></blockquote>

<p>5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.</p>

<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s going to be okay. I&rsquo;m still growing. I&rsquo;m still learning to depend on Jesus.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go find myself a hat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was out today on a long run (I&rsquo;m picking up training for the SF Half Marathon in late July). But it was hot&hellip; the thermostat was reading 90 degrees at 10 in the morning.</p>

<p>It was a really bad idea.</p>

<p>But I think I finally realized what Psalm 63 means:</p>

<blockquote><p>God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you;
   my soul thirsts for you;
my flesh faints for you,
   as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.</p></blockquote>

<p>Running in the sun with the heat unbearably invading every pore, I think I&rsquo;m viscerally experiencing what it&rsquo;s like to seek to crave the shade, to be inexorably drawn to it, to seek shelter. It&rsquo;s quite something to have nothing on your mind but the thought of water, to feel your body on the verge of crumbling until you can get yourself to a fountain and drink deeply and unashamedly.</p>

<p>I experienced today what it meant to know and thirst and crave the living God that much as if life itself depended on it. That&rsquo;s how I want to live.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Man. Where to even start?</p>

<p>I started working at Riverbed about three months ago. Three months! Time does fly.</p>

<p><em>What do you do?</em> I&rsquo;m a User Interface Developer with them, where I design the management interface to the Steelhead, their WAN acceleration product. What this means in plain English is that I design the look and feel of the control panel to their product, a network device that speeds up data transfer over a network.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not the sexiest thing to be doing, but hey it&rsquo;s my first full-time job. My boss is really cool and my coworkers are really fun. I think I&rsquo;m gonna learn a lot here.</p>

<p>I remember starting work and making a list of priorities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Relationships > work.</p></li>
<li><p> Personal life > work life (and learn how to separate the two)</p></li>
<li><p> Work hard &amp; work well.</p></li>
<li><p> Work to be generous.</p></li>
<li><p> Work as an act of worship.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m learning:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The rhythm of work life is like nothing I anticipated. It wasn&rsquo;t that total screeching halt that I braced myself for, but rather a slower, gradual fade into a 9A-6P rhythm. It&rsquo;s not pulling crazy demands on my personal life right now, but I definitely understand that desire to come in after work, sit down and veg out in front of the TV.</p></li>
<li><p> It&rsquo;s all about the relationships, and that&rsquo;s not easy. If I&rsquo;m going to be spending most of my life here at work, I really want to make it count. You know? I want these relationships to really mean something. Call me naive, but I think we can make real friends at work. And that requires a lot of effort.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I&rsquo;m discovering that this effort doesn&rsquo;t come easy. Because work life has greatly shrunk the scope of my outside activities, it means that there needs to be real effort to make room to chill with coworkers over a pitcher at the bar across the street, or attend my coworker&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s high school musical (haven&rsquo;t done that one yet!). And I&rsquo;m finding that oftentimes it&rsquo;s far easier to block out my whole schedule with things I plan but never leave room for the simple conversations that come my way every day.</p>

<ol>
<li> I thought that making money wasn&rsquo;t going to make me materialistic (that&rsquo;s quite a mouthful). I thought I knew how to live generously and it would come easy. After all, I came from college, right? I lived off food scraps and horribly improvised recipes/abominations (see: spaghetti sauce sandwich). I went to Intervarsity, right? I know what it&rsquo;s like to interface with the poor.</li>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy, guys.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m finding it&rsquo;s true that the more you make, the more you compare to those who have more. Oh, I make <em>x</em> dollars a year? Well my coworker makes <em>y</em> more than me, and he&rsquo;s only <em>z</em> quantity more/less experienced. And it&rsquo;s true, when you never thought money would be an idol, you find yourself wishing that you had extra space in your wallet for that extra purchase.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I&rsquo;m learning that the act of work itself is, well, worship. I&rsquo;m thinking that satisfaction you get when you finish a big project having put your heart and mind and strength into it is, well, a reflection of how God felt when he finished us up on the 7th metaphorical (or literal, depending on your take) day.</p></li>
<li><p> I also thought that giving would be more glamorous than it really was. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I imagined. Maybe lavish praise from friends and acquaintances. &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s so kind.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a generous fellow (which nobody can deny)&rdquo; At the very least, maybe a gold star in the books.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s true, what Jesus taught: &ldquo;But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.&rdquo; (Matt. 6:3). That&rsquo;s the ultimate suck-it-up unglamorous thing to do. That&rsquo;s zero recognition, not even from yourself. I think Jesus had a point when he said that. Don&rsquo;t look to the act of giving to give you your full satisfaction. Do it because your Father loves you; his Holy Spirit moves and breathes through you.</p>

<p>And so it is with the workplace as well; I&rsquo;m learning not to see it as my ultimate ends of satisfaction. I&rsquo;m trying hard not to let it dictate my mood for the day or my pace of life in general. I&rsquo;m working out what it means to have a career, to have skills, talents, passions, and to explore and expand them in the context of this new rhythm of life.</p>

<p>I think I make this transition out to be a lot harder than it actually is. I need to remember that I do these things because the Spirit moves and breathes through me. And in light of that, I can chill.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I&rsquo;ve been here last, things have changed. I graduated from college, went to Africa, started working in the City, changed churches, moved homes. In the span of one week, I&rsquo;m in San Francisco, then Emeryville, then Saratoga, then Oakland and back. I&rsquo;ve said goodbye to friends, made new ones, and rediscovered old ones.</p>

<p>I gotta be honest, I&rsquo;ve never felt so lost in my life.</p>

<p>But this is a good place. This is a different place. I&rsquo;m going to be sitting down and writing more from here on out. It&rsquo;s my way of keeping track of myself and making sure I&rsquo;m still here.</p>

<p>This is day one. I am going to start by going to bed.</p>
