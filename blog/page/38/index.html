  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m having one heckuva time trying to get this CS160 code working.<br/>
(Mutters incoherently)<br/>
Swing/SWT gurus, please show me how. I will love you for it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Clovers and Blue Moons<br/>
I realized today I have fulfilled Childhood Dream #4: When I grow up, I can eat tons of Lucky Charms and nobody will tell me it&rsquo;s bad for me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Captain&rsquo;s Log, 10.17.2006, 7:45PM<br/>
There is no room to sit in this lab. TA Jerry enters the door with a bag of Jolly Ranchers and writes &ldquo;Because coding sucks less w/ sugar&rdquo; on the board. Hail, TA Jerry.</p>

<p>11:45PM<br/>
330 Soda smells desperate. The men (and women) are madly pressing away at their button-tray-like contraption. Send food. Quickly, Mom.</p>

<p>12:36AM<br/>
TA Jerry is looking more and more frazzled as laser printers run out of toner and as a clamorous group of red-eyed CS students press in around him like baby birds snapping away a worm held in their mother&rsquo;s beak. I&rsquo;ll refrain from terrible analogies in the future, thank you.</p>

<p>1:04AM<br/>
Eyes&hellip; bleary&hellip; contacts&hellip; scratchy. Yang (my partner) makes a big breakthrough regarding an event listener. I also think that these Anoto pens are nowhere near production quality; if a roomful of geeky CS majors muttering obcenities under their breath cannot get this application to work, nobody can. The list of printers in Soda that can support our project is quickly dwindling to two. Panic runs high. There is talk of mutiny.</p>

<p>1:25AM<br/>
Standards getting lower. A group has brought in sandwiches and sodas and are merrily chewing away a few workstations down from us. They are eyed hungrily by the rest of us. Fools, don&rsquo;t they know that coding is optimal on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>1:46AM<br/>
Partner has become delirious and is making bad jokes. TA Jerry is still running around at a million miles an hour. Room is still at 70% capacity. The thought of writing the readme doc in limerick rhyme seriously crosses my mind.</p>

<p>2:06AM<br/>
They are tapping out; they are dropping like flies. One by one. Heads on keyboards. Exeunt.</p>

<p>2:39AM<br/>
Lord, I don&rsquo;t want to die in here. Yang and I agree that we&rsquo;re pretty darn close. &ldquo;Life is much more than getting a CS project right.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll sleep on it.</p>

<p>3:04AM<br/>
&ldquo;Okay guys&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to start heading home now&rdquo; TA Jerry tells us. Jer-ry, Jer-ry, Jer-ry! Yang tells me he&rsquo;s going to sleep over at Soda. I tell him I&rsquo;ve never done that, and was hoping I&rsquo;d never have to. Yang states matter-of-factly that that&rsquo;s exactly when boys become men. I tell him I&rsquo;ll wait a little longer, then I peace out of there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m mentally &amp; physically drained, but spiritually refreshed.</p>

<p>Thanks y&#8217;all who ask me questions and help me process. I need it.</p>

<p>Community can be very, very, very beautiful. I&rsquo;m going to miss this specific one when I leave Cal (too early to think about this!) And to think I almost gave up on it &ndash; the cynicism is melting. I won&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s completely gone but I know he&rsquo;s a Good Shepherd and the waters are deep.</p>

<p>Dang. I won&rsquo;t be as ambiguous in the future. But much of it has been spending more time at the feet of my Father, and less of it building my own card-castles. Much of it has been chewing on the hard stuff and counting the costs of following but seeing how worth it it is.</p>

<p>And finally, maybe it&rsquo;s just shedding that cynicism (thinly veiled as pride) that&rsquo;s haunted me for the past year or so. I can&rsquo;t exactly pinpoint why. But having that &ldquo;heart of stone&rdquo; replaced with a &ldquo;heart of flesh&rdquo; is very, very freeing.</p>

<p>I feel either like a pardoned prisoner, a lovesick fool or something strangely in between.</p>

<hr />

<p>One thing that makes me sad is losing touch with friends. It&rsquo;s a sad side-effect of time &amp; life.</p>

<hr />

<p>A massively tough week ahead:<br/>
Monday a CS160 midterm<br/>
Tuesday a Soc5 group assignment<br/>
Wednesday CS162 design document<br/>
Wednesday CS160 initial code due<br/>
Here we goooooooo</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For maybe the past two weeks God has been weaving and speaking a very specific message to me. Every conversation, prayer, sermon, event, class and encounter is all wrapped up into this. Oh my God. I need maybe another week to process this. Incredible. Mind-blowing. Face-meltingly humbling.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t use the word &ldquo;life-changing&#8221;ï¿½yet, but I think certain assumptions in my walk are being challenged and for the first time I realize I can&rsquo;t skirt the infinitely excellent paradoxes of God. It&rsquo;s time I manned up and face the question of personal holiness in light of a holy God, it&rsquo;s time I opened my eyes to the brokenness of community and faced the challenge of offering a human-grace on behalf of a divine-grace so perfect I have only cracked open the first layer.</p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s Oregon game freakin&#8217; rocked (we dominated 45-24, and moved up to #10). Times like these I am absolutely unabashedly proud of my school. Fun moment: watching Nobel Prize-winning physics prof George Smoot lead cheers and standing up and screaming at the top of my lungs, &ldquo;I LOOVE PHYSICS!&rdquo; And nobody shot me any dirty looks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is it strange that I don&rsquo;t listen to the lyrics of the songs I listen to? I&rsquo;ve been listening to the Fray CD for about two hours now and I don&rsquo;t remember a single refrain (except from that overplayed &ldquo;How to Save a Life&rdquo; single). Of course, this is whilst studying. Maybe it&rsquo;s just my preferred method of music consumption: ambience over cognitive brain-food.</p>

<p>I wonder what I would come up with if I actually plumbed the depths of the songs I listened to. Beauty! Eloquence! Crass irony! Tired cliches! Rivers of emo tears!</p>

<p>I wonder if my subconscious is processing any of these messages. The masscomm major in me would have a field day.</p>

<p>(There is a moral to this story.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Physically speaking, I&rsquo;m completely better. Thanks for the prayers and cough drops, guys. It feels good to have a clear throat and clear head. On the minus side, Charles is sick (thanks to me). So pray for him too (I feel hecka bad&hellip; he&rsquo;s moaning and coughing in bed right now).</p>

<p>Themes in my life lately: humility, faith, brokenness. (needing more-, growing in-, understanding-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to understand this 239423-dimensional agape love of the Father and really understanding how feeble my own love is. How is it possible to love like You did? Lately I&rsquo;m having so much trouble distilling my emotions from my motivations from good ol&#8217; truth. How could you have loved so intensely, so personally, so universally? I don&rsquo;t understand it. I&rsquo;m so imperfect.</p>

<p>I am going nowhere in particular with this post.</p>

<p>I kind of miss feeling. Berkeley + busyness has done it. Am I numb? Spiritually, emotionally? I&rsquo;m just a little weary.</p>

<p>There was swing dancing under Sather Gate on Friday. The atmosphere was just right. The gate was lit (save for the bulb on the far end), the music was pleasant and there was this energetic vibe. Folks started clapping along to the music and I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile.</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m returning to that dry place I was at last semester, but it&rsquo;s not the same place. Sure, it&rsquo;s filled with uncertainty, but it&rsquo;s no longer lonely; it&rsquo;s replaced with a confident trust in the Father that He will lead me out again. Ps.23</p>

<p>I love fall in Berkeley. Just minus the rain.</p>

<p>CS projects are eating up my life. I have about 3-4 meetings a week, each between an hour and five hours long. The worst part? It hasn&rsquo;t even gotten bad yet.</p>

<p>I can trust I can trust I can trust. Solid rock.</p>

<p>I saw Mike again for the first time in three weeks &mdash; twice. First in front of Asian Ghetto, the second in front of Fat Slice. He&rsquo;s been interviewing for jobs, but none of them have panned out. &ldquo;I like to put a smile on people&rsquo;s faces&rdquo; he tells me. &ldquo;Cash, check, credit card?&rdquo; he calls out to passerbys. They look down at their shoes. &ldquo;No change!&rdquo; he finishes, and they chuckle. One lady turns around and gives him the sweetest smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew, come see me again,&rdquo; he calls out to me after we share a meal. It is my first realization that we are friends.</p>

<p>I want to write, but everything&rsquo;s been said.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Every hour every hour every hour) I need thee every hour. I&rsquo;m a broken person, and I can&rsquo;t believe how easy it is to forget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kind of wish we were back in first grade&rdquo; my friend Jon mentioned in the car last weekendï¿½which got me thinking. (Childhood was a blur to me) but for this one memory.</p>

<p>In retrospect I don&rsquo;t know why I did it, but for love. I am about eight, and I lay in my Dad&rsquo;s lap (it is my only recollection of doing so). He puts his hand on my head, and I know I am loved. (Is it strange that I don&rsquo;t know why I did it? Does it even matter?)</p>

<p>In many ways I grew up too quickly, and I long to be a child oftentimes these days. I have this idea it is because I am oftentimes tired, or directionless, or insecure and simply realize that I cannot carry myself.</p>

<p>Man, God, I just want to be a child and know You are.</p>

<p>But Jesus called the children to him and said, &ldquo;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.&rdquo; (Luke 18:16)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve heard so much about stillness and rest that it&rsquo;s just this fuzzy idea up in the ephemeral air that never materializes in real-space. Do I have to fight for stillness (the irony!) I have to work for it, huh? I have to step back and take a big ol&#8217; swipe and knock that metaphorical junk off my metaphorical desk. Doubly ironic!</p>

<p>The more I read Jesus&#8217; words, the less they make sense to me; is it (no!) so simple?<br/>
Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me (John 15:4)</p>
