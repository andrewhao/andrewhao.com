  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/6568458747/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7027/6568458747_9c0dfcd0b7.jpg" alt="DSC_0243" /></a></p>

<p>He looks into me with soft eyes, and sings in Mandarin: &ldquo;Look into His face / and your worries will disappear with the light of the sun&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not bad for his age. Apparently he sings in the elderly folks&#8217; choir at his church. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the only one who can sing!&rdquo; laughs my dad.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re sitting in a hotel restaurant, filled to the brim with Christmastime muzak and chatty customers. I feel the restaurant growing quieter as he continues to sing, a throaty baritone voice growing more confident as I grow more self-conscious at the same time.</p>

<p>My yie yie (爺爺)&rsquo;s eyes are becoming dimmer with the years, I can see, hiding under bushy, busy white eyebrows and thick, leathery suntanned skin. Coming over with the KMT from the mainland was tough on him. My dad would tell me of Yie yie&rsquo;s extended military deployments in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. His past is a storied and shrouded one, working for Chinese intelligence doing radio surveillance. After splitting with his unit during the upheavals of the Revolution, he came to Taiwan to work again for KMT intelligence, eavesdropping on the very same people he used to work with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Japan was especially nice&rdquo;, Yie yie recounts with a smile. He was stationed with US troops on a military base, and he tells us stories of watching a movie every night, eating great food. He is a young man, still. He keeps a journal of each movie he sees, and the journal grows thick over the year. A mischievous smile grows over Yie yie&rsquo;s face as he recounts how he&rsquo;d smuggle hard-boiled eggs from the cafeteria in his pants pockets, only to spill them all over the basketball court in a pickup game hours later.</p>

<p>How old is he in those years?, I wonder. He couldn&rsquo;t have been much older than I am now. Does he enjoy Coke? How about mangoes? I imagine him writing his wife, asking about my father as a young boy. The world is a different place. He tells a story of losing close friends in a Vietcong mortar attack in Vietnam, and his eyes grow misty. Smoke rises from the jungles, and I wonder if he ever wonders why he, and by extension my father and myself, are spared.</p>

<p>My dad would never get to see his dad much during those years, and when he came back, most of his memories of Yie yie were of an ill-tempered man he&rsquo;d tend to hide from. But something happened in the intervening years after Yie yie came home for good. He softened out. Jesus got to him.</p>

<p>I wanted to come here to find myself in Yie yie and his life. I want to know his strength and determination to live, and realize that there is much more beneath the surface of the man that I&rsquo;ve only seen sitting down, smiling and laughing. What keeps a man rooted even when he is swept about?</p>

<p>Right now, Yie yie&rsquo;s singing Psalm 23. &ldquo;Can you remember the words?&rdquo; my dad asks as Yie yie struggles through the verses. The Lord is my shepherd. He leads me through quiet waters. I fear no evil.</p>

<p>He can remember them just fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck.</p>

<p>Now that the race is over with, I&rsquo;m left feeling surprisingly empty. I guess it shouldn&rsquo;t have been a surprise, all those mornings spent on trails were easy ways to feel productive, or to grab a endorphin rush and start the day right. I wake up too early now and crawl onto my knees in bed and just kind of slouch there under the covers, shaking off the fog of sleep, half-waking-half-dreaming-half-wishing I were somewhere else.</p>

<p>I missed Boston by 17 seconds, and I try not to let the significance of the fact get by me. I tell myself it&rsquo;s okay to feel disappointed, to prevent myself from saying oh, it&rsquo;s no big deal, next year. I&rsquo;m trying to accept that I am disappointed.</p>

<p>I am disappointed, I am disappointed. I have to tell myself this sometimes, from the outside looking in, and bear the weight of it on my shoulders through my heart. Like: the angry plantar fasciitis. The soggy shoes and fumbly umbrella. Cooking a crappy soup. My inability to make sense of my love life. A week of rain. Not even liking, much less loving Oakland.</p>

<p>This I&rsquo;m learning: laughter is my cover and cloak. Having the right answers is my defense.</p>

<p>I tried to describe to Jeff this morning how it felt, and I was surprised I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. Well, it was a sorta lonely feeling. I&rsquo;ll start from there. I realized in the shower the other morning that I hated <em>waiting</em>. Recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to distract myself. I know it&rsquo;s not helpful, but I&rsquo;d much rather be with the noise, the shiny stuff, the city din, the glitterati.</p>

<p>Henri Nouwen talks about allowing loneliness to drive you to the seat of your true desire: being close to the Father. Father, I wonder sometimes what the hell I am doing with my life. I want to know I want to know I want to know. When I was younger I used to pray: <em>Jesus, be my only satisfaction</em> with total abandonment. It sounds completely ridiculous, but I honestly didn&rsquo;t expect to be here being asked of that now. I want human hands, I want tangible touch, I want a genuine experience, and soul-connection and laughter and tears.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s selfish, Jesus, but on the other hand it&rsquo;s not. I just want to believe it is from you, and I can experience it, and I can wait and say you met me on the other side. Can I ask that? Dare I ask that? I don&rsquo;t want trite answers. I want to sit in the seat of the valleys and remain there and say I waited patiently and he came, he really did.</p>

<p>Jonathan mentioned that at our home group the other week. What do you want, I asked him. I want to hear him say he&rsquo;s proud of me, he answered, and I thought it the most genuine thing I&rsquo;ve heard in a while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been wont to complain about how it sucks to be doing my training in the gym. Ever since I tweaked my foot I&rsquo;ve been feeling caged on the treadmill and elliptical machines. On the machines I can&rsquo;t think about anything, it&rsquo;s too stuffy and hot and I&rsquo;m always dripping with sweat. I&rsquo;m always staring at numbers, cursed numbers. It makes me remember how I hated running track in high school, and the unforgiving numbers that come with it.</p>

<p>On the flip side it&rsquo;s been breathtaking getting out and realizing that I&rsquo;ve been taking nature for granted. It&rsquo;s a gift to have your mind wander. It&rsquo;s a gift to roam over mossy earth. I ran out over the Oakland hills this morning to see a blanket of clouds glowing through the sunlight and pouring out over the hills into the Bay. I both wished I had my camera with me and was glad I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My grandfather (ah gong, or 外公, but we call him gong gong), driven by winds of Communist change, arrived in Taiwan in the 1940s. He was a Fuzhou businessman, 26 at the time. He was a businessman, relatively wealthy and educated, and fled from the incoming Communists.</p>

<p>He met my grandmother (ah ma, or 外媽 &mdash; but we&rsquo;ve grown up calling her puo puo) while they both worked as schoolteachers at the same elementary school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ah gong was a handsome man&rdquo; my grandmother says with a chuckle and a glimmer in her eye. She is dignified, ladylike, and precise. She bears eyes with depth, holding her teacup with deliberate old-world delicacy. My early memories are sprinkled with her constant presence in our house, making fantastic food and reading me chinese fables for bedtime stories.</p>

<p>They met in the years in between the world wars, when the world was changing. My grandma was native Taiwanese, telling me about the world she grew up in, hearing American bombers fly overhead, when alarms would sound and they would have to head to the mountains to hide in the hills. Taiwan was different then, they were raised to believe they were Japanese.</p>

<p>They fell in love, but they don&rsquo;t speak much about it nowadays. I wonder how it was back then. She was trained as a schoolteacher, and he must have been good with the kids given his gregarious charm. It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine why they fell in love, but how? I wonder if they can still remember.</p>

<p>These days, they live in Taipei in a modern apartment, paneled in marble and dark wood. His hands tremble when they reach for the dishes on the table. She reaches for the dish and steadies it for him. After each meal he silently shuffles to the couch and picks his teeth with a toothpick and looks out the window at the glassy beams of the Taipei 101 tower.</p>

<p>Her family would have nothing to do with him. He was an outsider, one of the KMT occupiers. Stories ran rampant about KMT men looking for Taiwanese wives while keeping a wife back in China. What did my great-grandfather think of him? Did they ever meet? Or did he forbid their love from the outside?</p>

<p>So they eloped.</p>

<p>Annie asks if puo-puo gets tired of cooking for us. My dad laughs. &ldquo;I bet she loves it that we&rsquo;re here. She loves to cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spread is enormous. Taro fish ball soup, fresh steamed fish from the market, boiled chicken, dumplings, radish salad, an array of steamed vegetables and guavas and wax apples for dessert. We lay there after each meal, stunned and deliriously happy.</p>

<p>My mom would tell me about how in the years down the road after their marriage, gong-gong would eventually win over my grandmother&rsquo;s family with his kindness, generosity, and charm and twinkle in his eye. I wonder what it was like, a slow, gradual warming, a reconciliation that may have taken years to mend.</p>

<p>My uncle calls us when we&rsquo;re there, asking if they want to come with them on their upcoming vacation to Japan. Puo-puo hesitates, smiling a bit, thinking. When she is thinking, she knits her brow and blinks slowly. It&rsquo;s her reserved nature that defines her elegance, I decide. But she is like a wall, difficult to read. I want to ask her about her young love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she finally says, &ldquo;I should stay here. It&rsquo;s cold in Japan. And I need to be with your dad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later as we sit around the living room sharing our hopes for the new year (my dad puts us through these things) gong-gong makes an innocent face and tells us that his hope is that &ldquo;your puo-puo should visit Japan and get out of the house and not have to take care of me.&rdquo; She smiles.</p>

<p>Gong-gong is always dressed well: suede jackets, pressed wool, a sleek Kangol cap and shiny loafers. These days, he&rsquo;s still dapper but much less mobile. His walk is reduced to a shuffle.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s shrunk over the years, but his charm is still there, shrouded by ailing health. As we leave, he grabs my arm and tells me he&rsquo;d like to attend my wedding soon and leaves me a kiss on the neck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the days when the weather is right, I swear I can feel the tickle of young love: the kind that’s radiant, inviting, and easy to fall into. It’s simple and charming and as light as goosefeathers.</p>

<p>On some odd days, I can vaguely remember the approach to the precipice of old love, woolen, worn &amp; monumental. We knew we were on the verge of crossing, but never sure how to look over to the other side. Young love is easy, I realize, but old love is not.</p>

<p>Old love is familiar yet ill-fitting, like bumping shoulders with strangers in elevators. You never notice it arriving, and when it has, it’s morphed. The taste changes in your mouth; the notes go all blue and glassy like black piano keys.</p>

<p>I tried to hold her loneliness once, balancing it between both palms and guessing at its secrets. Like most notebooks go, it was silent and weighty and important. We bound it back up quickly, leaving crinkles in the seams. Sometimes I still wonder if I could have borne its weight.</p>

<p>Looking back, it was my embarrassment that caught me off guard. Nobody told me about it, a bottled-up outside-in feeling, a silly and shameful confusion. I felt childlike, at a loss of answers, wanting to hide. This I’ve learnt, too: I must run quickly to the father, before my armor thickens.</p>

<p><em>Yahweh is my father</em> I heard someone once cry, and I will do the same. He has gifted us a hundred sadnesses for our good, and we will soon (soon) sing songs in firelight and know again the barely-floating sensations of joy. He is the one who has ordained for us the seasons. I will yield to his grip and submit to his kiln. <em>Stay low to the ground</em> I heard once, and felt it True.</p>
