  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been wrestling with a lot of identity issues and insecurities lately. I&rsquo;ve invited them all to run amuck in my mind. Among them:</p>

<p>Who am I? What are ways in which I hurt others? What do I need to change about myself&mdash;and what things can I stand confidently in? Am I a bad student, boyfriend, leader, bro, son?</p>

<p>Then these questions invite their friends over:</p>

<p>Where will I be in a year? What are my passions? How do I navigate the tension between doing what I love and doing what&rsquo;s right and doing what&rsquo;s safe (not that they&rsquo;re mutually exclusive)? Will one come at the expense of the others? Can I mature and still have dreams?</p>

<p>And soon it becomes a Veritable Reunion:</p>

<p>Is it healthy to let some relationships taper off&mdash;even before it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye? Am I emotionally distant or am I just trying to cope? How do you sew a button onto a shirt? Who will I know in a year?</p>

<p>&mdash;
Hey, God. I just want to know that you love me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a heckuva week. Things have been moving quickly. There are events to plan and attend. Work has been piling higher. Group projects are scheduling themselves in (I&rsquo;m in three this semester). Life, well, life is life: My car battery died, I lost my wallet and all my credit cards and ID.  I&rsquo;ve been sleeping a bit less&mdash;those late nights in Soda Hall are taking their toll. Things would, at first glance, suck.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t found myself stressed. I&rsquo;m really happy. No joke.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s something about perspective. Something about reminding yourself, &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;ve got a roof over my head and easy access to food and amazing friends and family and a good heavenly dad.&rdquo; I have so many gifts; so many things I don&rsquo;t deserve at all.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about making priorities and keeping them. Admittedly, I&rsquo;m terrible at this. But I think when life gets crazy you have to choose what is most important to you and stick to &lsquo;em. For me, that&rsquo;s time kicking it with the Father. That&rsquo;s having time to spend with Sarah. That&rsquo;s vowing to eat my meals at regular hours.</p>

<p>On the flip side, that means not burning the candle at both ends to get that CS project turned in. That means saying no to people and being okay with asking for more time.</p>

<p>So much of life is about balance (and some things are not&mdash;some you must go all out for. More on that in a bit). All this to say that I&rsquo;ve been good. I&rsquo;d like to be more regular about writing. I hope you&rsquo;ll stick with me on this journey.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Argh! So much to do in so little time. I figured I&rsquo;d take some time to write this so I could consider that something done.</p>

<p>But no, seriously :D Life is good. I just need to organize and methodically do everything on this darned to-do list. Interesting things will appear in this space. I promise.</p>

<p>Just give me some time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mike calls me as I drive into Berkeley this morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Andrew, it&rsquo;s Mike, I&rsquo;m at Highland [hospital]. My heart give out last night, my arm start hurtin&#8217; and I had to go to the ER. They wanna admit me for a few days, but I&rsquo;ll get out though. They treat me like I&rsquo;m dying or something, but I&rsquo;m not gonna die. Anyways, go on ahead Drew, I&rsquo;ll see you in a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With all these trips into and out from the hospital, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that Mike&rsquo;s condition is life-threatening. I whisper a silent prayer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is it so wrong to want to vote for Obama because you like his rhetoric?  Because you find him likable, gosh darn it. I agree (mostly) with his domestic platform, (mostly) on foreign policy, a little less on the so-called &ldquo;moral&rdquo; issues. But the guy seems like a level-headed leader I&rsquo;d like to call President.</p>

<p>Heh, there&rsquo;s only so much I have to say here (I&rsquo;ve been pretty mum about my political leanings, mostly because I haven&rsquo;t had any for the longest time). I guess I&rsquo;m trying to explain this sense of excitement and even gratitude in an admittedly-imperfect political system that I can take part in. And I&rsquo;m trying to disentangle the mess of strident voices in my head telling me: I&rsquo;m wrong, I&rsquo;m ignorant, I haven&rsquo;t prayed, I haven&rsquo;t understood these implications <em>fully</em>.</p>

<p>When will I <em>fully</em> grasp what&rsquo;s at stake? There&rsquo;s only so much you can know about a candidate, right? You have to pray you&rsquo;ve seen past the hype, peered into the issues and stood by your convictions. After a while, in good faith and conscience, you have to vote going on what (little) you know.</p>

<p>So I researched, I prayed, and today I voted. I hope you do the same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been at Citibank for years now, but I&rsquo;ve been putting most of my money into an E<em>Trade savings account (where I get a 4.4% return). Okay, let&rsquo;s ignore the fact that E</em>Trade has been going through some rough patches lately (thanks to tanking subprime loans)&hellip; but I feel like that&rsquo;s a pretty smart thing to do.</p>

<p>So at the beginning of break, I transferred much of my Citibank account out to E*Trade. And my checks and my credit cards are all linked to Citibank. But it kind of helps me budget my money when I only see a low amount of money in my Citi accounts. It really forces me to consider my purchases and save.</p>

<p>But of course, the expenses and charges add up. Rebate checks don&rsquo;t come in as fast as you expect them to. I&rsquo;m stubborn and refuse to transfer money back into Citi. Credit card payments add up. People cash my checks instantly. And suddenly I&rsquo;m trying to ride it out to the end of the month and praying I&rsquo;ll make it to Feb. 1 without bottoming out at zero. (Feb. 1 is when my parents add my allowance for the month. Thanks, Mom and Dad!)</p>

<p>Oh man, I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> close, but I don&rsquo;t make it. On Jan 30, a check gets cashed that overdraws my account by $5. That incurs a service charge of $5 again. My Citi accounts are at a beautiful sum of &ndash;$10 dollars.</p>

<p>On Jan 31, my parents rescue me (thanks, Mom &amp; Dad!).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a few things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Artificially lowering the money in the bank really does alter your spending habits.</p></li>
<li><p> &hellip;but obviously not enough. I thought I&rsquo;d be far more frugal than I was.</p></li>
<li><p> Always keep track of checks you write and make sure there is room in your account. Never assume they&rsquo;ve all been cashed.</p></li>
<li><p> I need a budget. And the gumption to stick to it. More on this later.</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a> rocks.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I also have a question for you all: My account was overdrawn for a day (&ndash;$10). What happens during that one day? What sorts of fees did I incur? My check didn&rsquo;t bounce, so who temporarily spotted me the difference until I could get my account in the black?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent a good four hours today digging through <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> code, trying to get our <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ccf">Cal Christian Fellowship</a> Web site back up.</p>

<p>The problem: the page seemed to freeze when loading page content. The request would time out, leaving a half-loaded page sans content. I dug into the theme at first, trying to track down which function call could have barfed. I tracked it into the apply_filters() call in the the post.</p>

<p>Wordpress uses a filtering system to manage content. This lets us add filters over all kinds of content. I realize that the problem was stemming from the <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/TextControl">Text Control</a> plugin, where something had barfed!</p>

<p>I disabled the plugin and voila! We were good to go again.</p>

<p>Since we only really used Textile markup on the CCF site, I just re-enabled the default Textile plugin and we were back in business.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know for the life of me what went wrong over the weekend in the Text Control plugin, but I don&rsquo;t have the cajones or the time to dig through server logs, et. al. and find out.</p>

<p>Geeking out like nobody&rsquo;s business,</p>

<p>-Andrew</p>
