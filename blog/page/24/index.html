<time datetime="2007-11-15T00:10:49-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 15<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Clinging onto the following:</p>

<h4>The simplicity of the G-spel:</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<blockquote><p><em>But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, __even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)&hellip;</em> &ndash; Ephesians 2:5-7</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>

<h4>Shreds of indefatigable faith</h4>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it all comes from, but a fraction of me knows You Love (me you them) even when I don&rsquo;t know who I am anymore (even when I want to give up on you, even when I want to drop this all and run).</p>

<h4>The person of Jesus</h4>

<p>Son of God. Political revolutionary. Light-bringer, hypocrisy-exposer. Rabbi, teacher, leader. Savior, superhero, tattered servant. Miracle worker, wounded healer. King, king, king.</p>

<h4>Hope</h4>

<p><strong>In heaven: </strong></p>

<blockquote><p><em>&hellip;we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.</em> &ndash; Romans 8:23b-25</p></blockquote>

<p>That keeps me going. Dad, I just want to know you. When we meet, I anticipate being slack-jawed, wide-eyed, stunned, and speechless. My heart will race, my throat will be dry, I&rsquo;ll be deliriously happy and breathless.</p>

<p><strong>In the Church: </strong></p>

<p>(I use the term &ldquo;Church&rdquo; referring to &ldquo;we ragtag band of Jesus-followers.&rdquo;)</p>

<blockquote><p><em>For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. </em>&ndash; Ephesians 2:10</p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a little too quick to give up on us. Maybe the church can be the voice of hope to the poor, broken, and brokenhearted in this world. Maybe the church will wake up from its slumber of materialism and learn to give selflessly. Maybe the church will stop thinking about its own needs and start wondering how it can meet the needs of others. Maybe by moving forward in action, we&rsquo;ll be changed and enthralled and delighted by the joy given to us by the Father.</p>

<p>Maybe the church will get an infusion of the Father&rsquo;s DNA. Maybe, just maybe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past week I&rsquo;ve heard voices that remind me of my failures and <em>inadequacy</em>&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m struggling academically because I&rsquo;m not working hard enough.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m turned down for interviews because I&rsquo;m not smart enough.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m trapped in cycles of sin because I haven&rsquo;t been applying myself to prayer/Scripture/meditation.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m no longer a dreamer because I&rsquo;ve burnt out.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m single because I&rsquo;m afraid to take risks (e.g. too careful).</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m passive because I lack some component of manhood.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This has been a rough time of wrestling. My identity in Jesus is really in tatters right now, and all this condemnation has really been tough to bear.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>And He has said to me, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.&rdquo; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.</em> &ndash; 2 Corinthians 12:9</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Identity crises</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m at a CS review session, and the three folks sitting in seats in front of me have their laptops out. One guy pulls out his Mac, the other two have PC laptops. Every one of them is running Linux. (Hint: Linux users get geek cred among their peers&mdash;it&rsquo;s what all the cool kids do).</p>

<p>Hear that? That&rsquo;s the sound of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates crying.</p>

<h4>Guilty pleasures</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m walking through Sproul Plaza and the guy in front of me gets stopped by this Flyering Guy for a campus event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interested in a campus Super Smash Brothers tournament?&rdquo; Flyering Guy asks.</p>

<p>The guy in front of me tries to act like he&rsquo;s not interested, but his body language gives it away and he stutter-steps. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he snatches a flyer from Flyering Guy with a sheepish grin.</p>

<p>Flyering Guy lets out a long, loud chuckle. &ldquo;Melee,&rdquo; he yells after Sheepish Guy, &ldquo;Melee.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been slightly scattered lately.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not doing too well in school&mdash;I&rsquo;m trying to redouble my efforts and study disciplines. And even though I got over a bulk of my academic insecurities years ago, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a little bit of panic and the occasional disappointment in myself when I realize I <em>most definitely</em> could have tried harder. (Last week I started handwriting notes in class and sitting in the front row&hellip; just like frosh year).</p>

<p>Small group leading is a bigger role than I realized. It&rsquo;s incredibly rewarding and I love our group. It&rsquo;s also been a larger time commitment than I&rsquo;ve expected. I&rsquo;ve been staring a lot of my insecurities, immaturity and limitations in the face and realizing that I really need Jesus to do this.</p>

<p>Oh yeah&mdash;I&rsquo;ve decided to take an extra semester (but I&rsquo;ll be walking with y&#8217;all in May). The bad <a href="news:">news:</a> I think I&rsquo;m going to have to do it as an Extension student (long story, but you can ask me if you want gory details). The good <a href="news:">news:</a> I&rsquo;ll be able to get the <a href="http://cet.berkeley.edu">CET</a> Management of Technology Certificate.</p>

<p>Peering out hazy windows into postgrad years is something you need to experience as a senior. On one hand, I&rsquo;m really excited to apply what I&rsquo;ve learned these years in the real world. On the other hand, there&rsquo;s the <em>uncertainty</em> and <em>all those choices</em> that I&rsquo;m really hesitant to tackle. What job? Where to take it? East Bay, South Bay, or Peninsula? Stay at home or live away? What is community next year and where will it be?  (An aside: I&rsquo;m thankful that I even have this education, these choices, and the freedom to make them. Whatta gift).</p>

<p>Anybody who claims to be out of the clutches of Senior Scramble is lying, or is missing a certain cardiovascular organ. The trick is trusting Jesus to transform pathetic desperation-mentalities into balanced identities (I think this phenomena is worth exploring in future posts&hellip; maybe).</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve been scattered, if only by virtue of new inputs and new decisions. It&rsquo;s all new and foreign to me, but it&rsquo;s part of life. Some would say we&rsquo;re growing up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So call it the naivete of the young, but isn&rsquo;t life supposed to happen in <em>the city</em>? Weren&rsquo;t we supposed to defy the Man and his associate powers-that-be by living bohemian lifestyles, wandering from metropolis to metropolis, drinking in the flavors and colors and noises of life?</p>

<p>You know what I mean. Weren&rsquo;t we meant to be young forever, crashing at friends&#8217; places, taking road trips, wasting long hours in front of the TV? I thought we were going to lounge our afternoons away in coffee shops talking epistemology, Burmese politics, predestination, the Warriors. I thought we were just going to cruise the dazzling coast on the days we felt like it, our feet heavy on the gas pedal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to lump all of my fears of the future together and project them into the idea of <em>going home to suburbia</em>. Honestly speaking, it&rsquo;s less about suburbia than it is about going home. Going home validates some sort of regression in my life. It marks an end to all of my relationships. It means returning to a hazy, somewhat unresolved future.</p>

<p>But the <em>city</em>, man, the <em>city</em>. The city is sexy. The city is full of life and enticements and activity and things to see. The city is Far. The city is full of wonderful strangers. The city is everything home is not.</p>

<p>I hate anticipating the future, describing my life and my plans in fifteen words to people I honestly don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going to see in a year. That uprooted feeling makes me nervous, but more so the feeling of <em>going back</em> to my roots. &ldquo;So this is it, huh?&rdquo; I fear telling myself next year. &ldquo;This is my fabulous life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, no, no! I know that my happiness isn&rsquo;t determined by where I live or what I do. I know this in a spiritual sense (I am reminded of dreams I used to have, dormant now). But these fears still manifest themselves in the idle hours between classes, at red lights and in the minutes before I close my eyes at night.</p>

<p>Maybe a routine isn&rsquo;t so bad. Maybe the 9-5 grind isn&rsquo;t all that hard to work out. Maybe I&rsquo;ll like the mazes of paved driveways and well-manicured lawns. I think that appeals to Domesticated Me. And heck, who&rsquo;s kidding who? I&rsquo;ve always liked safety and comfort. That won&rsquo;t. be. so. bad.</p>

<p>Does going home mean drabness and 9-5 prisons? Does going home just mean sucking it up and growing up? Does somebody need to smack some sense into me? Where is the <em>joie de vivre</em> in monochrome suburbia? Tell me, because I keep seeing myself there and I have a feeling it&rsquo;s what I think it is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three girls walk down Bowditch Ave at night. They&rsquo;re making lively conversation with a bounce in their step, talking loudly. One stops and slips a dollar bill by a homeless man sleeping under the Urban Outfitters window. She gives a tiny squeal and then quickly skips to catch up with her friends.</p>

<p>The man, now roused, turns to find the bill under his pillow.</p>

<p>Small things like that make me smile. Small things make me realize Berkeley&rsquo;s still got a heart.</p>
