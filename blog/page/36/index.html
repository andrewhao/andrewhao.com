  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am in the Berkeley prayer house in the &ldquo;waiting room&rdquo; and I am scribbling down pent-up thoughts that flow to me at an alarming pace. I write 20 bullet points and aim them upward in a &ldquo;Dear John&rdquo; letter. (Please skip the rest if emo writing makes you queasy).</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&hellip;<br/>
6. Jesus forgive me for believing lies that my sin is impossible to overcome. That I can never have victory, so why try? I am so defeated.<br/>
7. I AM SO FAR FROM YOU AND I AM TO BLAME (?)<br/>
8. I pray cliches. It has been so long since I&rsquo;ve prayed a heartfelt prayer&hellip;<br/>
&hellip;<br/>
11. FORGIVE ME FOR THIS CYNICISM THAT IS SUFFOCATING ME.<br/>
12. God I&rsquo;m afraid to say this but You don&rsquo;t mean much to me anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>(a blank page)</p>

<ol>
<li>My heart doesn&rsquo;t feel anymore. I am so dry. No, more than that&hellip; what is it?</li>
<li>I feel as I&rsquo;ve searched hard and ended up emptier than before. Jesus, I come to You with nothing, God. I am so tired.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m tired of running the race, fighting the good fight. I&rsquo;d like a break, God. 5 minutes.</li>
<li>It feels wrong to (say these things &amp; feel good saying them.)</li>
<li>I feel as if I&rsquo;m right back where I started, God. Still bitter. Still empty, still disobedient. Just with some extra scars&hellip;&#8221;</li>
</ol>


<p>Upstairs, they are praying, singing, jumping, laughing. &ldquo;Come breathe in me, all my life, take over / Come live in me I will rise on eagle&rsquo;s wings.&rdquo; I finish my last sentence and find myself breathless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://hsiufan.eats.porkbuns.net">Hsiu-fan</a> and I have been cracking away (well, he much more than I) at a new Rails web application. The concept? Easy, intuitive online signup sheets (a la mysignups.com, minus the circa-1996 look).</p>

<p>We had a heckuva time finding a name. What do you call this thing? We wanted a name that easily gave away the program&rsquo;s functionality without being too much of a mouthful. We wanted it to be.. well.. not dry, drab or boring. We wanted it to be easy to remember.</p>

<p>We decided to look for a domain name first, then name it accordingly (the guys at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">37signals</a> don&rsquo;t agree with this, arguing that you can always rig up a domain name after the naming fact).</p>

<p>But the problem was that every single domain with the mention of &ldquo;signup&rdquo; in it was, well, long gone. We decided to brainstorm, drawing up a mind map with clusters of words involving &ldquo;time&rdquo; &ldquo;slot&rdquo; &ldquo;signup&rdquo; &ldquo;sheet&rdquo; and adding all different permutations of the such. It looked somewhat like <image to come>.</p>

<p>Then we stepped back and thought, what is this app allowing us to do? We wrote down a bunch of ideas: signing up, coming together, rallying the troops, joining an event&hellip;</p>

<p>Hsiufan suggests, wejoinin. I check the domains, and it&rsquo;s clear!</p>

<p>Adblog Snark Hunting offers an <a href="http://www.snarkhunting.com/2006/11/zune-is-tune-with-a-z-2/">analysis of the &ldquo;Zune&rdquo; name</a>. A good look at the name/branding industry and how much thought goes into something that is trivial at first glance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I discovered Mike&rsquo;s last name a few weeks ago (and promptly forgot it the next day). I had been talking to him and he brought out his exit papers from his most recent visit to the hospital. There it was. He then showed me his Medicare card and I saw it again.</p>

<p>It begins with an R. Mike R&mdash;&mdash;. It&rsquo;s a shame that all I see are dashes.</p>

<p>It begins with an R. In other breaking news, it has occurred to me that I could just ask him.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are four of us in this room, keeping the six-o&#8217;clock watch marking the sun&rsquo;s descent in this myrtle-green nightclub undergoing transformation to a sacred space, sawdust filling our nostrils and uncovering shafts of light leaking from skylights (and I sneeze).</p>

<p>One corner of the room is a cafe in a half-constructed state with orange walls, orange booths and orange tables whose similarity to a &lsquo;50s diner is uncanny, down to the sticky vinyl seats and fading chrome accents around the seat bases.</p>

<p>A Latino man and his wife, renowned prayer intercessors (or so I am
told when they enter the room an hour earlier) are silently kneeling
in the center of the room, their lips moving and eyebrows furrowed in
intense concentration (I try to search for words to describe their expressions, and come up with nothing better than &ldquo;pleading&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The other end of the room is a wall of clear glass cubes affording a view at an empty concrete courtyard which previously saw life as a swimming pool, no doubt among the young, glitzy and the glamourous (tonight, it is barren).</p>

<p>My friend Andy, tall, bronzed and lanky in torn jeans and a &ldquo;Trust Me I&rsquo;m a Doctor&rdquo; tee shirt is walking about in a meandering circle, hands stuffed in his pockets and whispering confident words I cannot decipher as I only hear the escaping hisses of the &ldquo;s&rdquo; consonant.</p>

<p>sss (silence) ss tss (silence)</p>

<p>Three walls and the ceiling of the club are painted black (ironically), and I, sprawled out and lying on my back, imagine I am staring into a nighttime sky and not knowing what to pray, faced with the immense loneliness of stars and sky, wondering who am I (who I am) and what exactly I am praying for (for in two weeks I leave for college, releasing behind me a mess of unrealized hopes and hearsay)&mdash;little less sure if anything lies between the stars I see in dark ceilings.</p>

<p>(I remember watching a video in fifth grade&mdash;an array of numbers spins
up to 4.39 years&mdash;for the time light from our closest star, Alpha
Centauri, takes to reach the outer edges of our Solar System. The
thought of waiting four years for light had boggled my mind. What
happened in the meantime? Did darkness just wait? And who was counting?)</p>

<p>I still can&rsquo;t remember to this day how Andy and I met, but for meeting up with him after we had corresponded a couple of times via email and talking about his crazy idea of starting a student prayer vigil, 24s of hours continually (24 soon bloomed to 48 bloomed to 72) and every time we were unsure about going through with another one I just remember his confident yeah man, let&rsquo;s do it (there was no doubt).</p>

<p>Andy was one of the cool kids, but I suspect this was less because he was handsome or rode a Kawasaki motorbike (comparisons were drawn to Korean pop stars and helped his case with the ladies), but because he had this cool confidence about him that had his friends wonder where he got it, and they quickly wished he didn&rsquo;t have it when he got up on lunch tables during senior year at 12PM and started talking about Jesus-following (the faculty had asked him to stop but he couldn&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>The man motions to Andy and me to join them in the middle of the room; we gather and he begins to speak of the burden for the city and for the church, big things and beautiful things and humbling things and sorrowful things, and I see in this man the brokenness of a man whose heart is chained to the people his God loves (I change my mind, the correct word for his expression is &ldquo;mournful&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Then he begins to share God-inspired things to Andy, speaking out the Father&rsquo;s love for his son, speaking beautiful words into his future, beautiful words really, of leadership, of preparedness, of assurance, of confidence and of commissioning to Andy, who breathes deeply and keeps his eyes closed.</p>

<p>Then it&rsquo;s my turn, and I look up and wait for the stars on the ceiling to come down, for my pinpricks of faith amidst dashed hopes to suddenly fall ablaze from the sky and for this I will let him speak.</p>

<p>And the man, in a steady measured voice full of compassion, simply tells me God wants you to wait&mdash;and listen. So much. Keep waiting for him.</p>

<p>I brush aside those words and hastily suppress disappointment that they were not large-words, not even close! but words that demanded that I not have any (oh God, I know it is true.) Andy&rsquo;s hand is on my shoulder and we utter soundless words.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a strange art installation in the side of the Vuitton store here in the mall that my family walks through each night&mdash;a neon-rimmed iridescent parabolic reflector behind wall-to-wall glass, a bright bulb in the middle directing light into the center of the mall. Returning the gaze of the giant iris evokes a haunting fear of waking a sleeping giant.</p>

<p>Inscribed on the glass&mdash;&ldquo;Eye See You.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people of Hawaii are beautiful, every single one of them. They (as do we) come to the malls to buy into the promise of being more so, because companies are telling them they have blemishes to cover, muscle tone to build, bodies to flaunt, trends to keep up. Why? Because they are being watched. Who is? Nobody can tell me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even though these last like eight weeks have been a nonstop train wreck of deadlines, I feel oddly good. Balanced&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had peace all throughout this semester. It&rsquo;s kind of weird but I&rsquo;ve been stressing out less and simply resting a lot more. A part of it is having a solid sleep schedule (I slept 6 hours every night!). What does it mean to study &amp; learn as an act of worship? For me, it meant dismantling the school idol and making time for G. It meant managing my time so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to rush things last minute. It meant respecting my limits even when I felt the assignment wasn&rsquo;t perfect (hence, no all-nighters baby). It meant giving up my own performance expectations. It sucks that it&rsquo;s taken me like six years to learn that I am created with limits, but dude. It is good. Time with G is sweet and good for my soul. And man, He&rsquo;s faithful. I checked my transcript today&mdash;a;oiwjgawe how did you hook it up?!?</p>

<p>I feel older (in good ways). It&rsquo;s not something that I can put a finger on. Maybe if I contrasted Junior Me of this year against Wide-Eyed Me of frosh year with Slightly Angsty Me of soph year, you could see the difference. But part of it is simply gathering more responsibilities and getting to know older people. It&rsquo;s a new feeling, moving into a life path that is less paved. &ldquo;The twenties were confusing years,&rdquo; the older people in my community group tell me, &ldquo;the thirties are a good decade.&rdquo; Whoa, hang on, let me live these next 10 years first.</p>

<p>I was blessed to have an awesome CS 162 group that was crazy brilliant, diligent and downright fun. I might actually miss these guys.</p>

<p>Urbana&rsquo;s in less than a week, and I honestly don&rsquo;t know how to prepare for it. I read this guy&rsquo;s Xanga where he writes it totally blew him away and left him forever &ldquo;uncomfortable with comfort&rdquo; and middle-road Christianity. I don&rsquo;t know whether to embrace that or run from that, do you know what I mean? Jesus-following is all-or-nothing. I either wholeheartedly take up that cross, die to my dreams and hang onto what is Better or I take the safe way out (cuz faith is a ephemeral and oft-fleeting thing) and walk the easier road. And I do understand that following wholeheartedly looks different with every person according to G&rsquo;s plan and purpose.</p>

<p>The question, as it has always been for me, is a question of surrender. Can I hold onto my life just a little longer? I do remember struggling with the same thing years ago in high school, thinking that I chose a path. But times change and compasses decalibrate. Now that I&rsquo;ve built my castles up just a little more (say, after starting the degrees), it does get harder to turn the sand shovel and bucket over. God, redeem that. Help me work through this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in Hawaii now, just chillin&#8217; haha. My fam&rsquo;s up here in Honolulu taking it easy, seeing the sights. The weather here&rsquo;s a good 80 degrees (I&rsquo;m not missing the frigid SoBay weather at all). It&rsquo;s been good having time to slow down, enjoy time with the fam, process things in my head, and enjoy the beach. I&rsquo;m actually kicking it in a PMT place out here across from the convention center and a little wary of walking back to the hotel (the place is sorta shady after dark actually :D)</p>

<p>Pictures to come. Soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This semester I&rsquo;ve been slowly (and quietly) piecing together a list of options that I&rsquo;m considering for my near future. I realize that telling people that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m praying about it&rdquo; might be true, but I need to be taking some practical steps to narrow my focus.</p>

<p>Grad School: Okay, so my parents are pushing me down this path, but I&rsquo;d say as of now the likelihood of it is pretty small (subject to rapid change).<br/>
1. CS: I don&rsquo;t know, doing something hardcore, or at least just hard.<br/>
2. Information: Actually, (the idea of) this kind of excites me (see: Berkeley&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">iSchool</a>). Managing, visualizing, indexing, harnessing information in the connected world.<br/>
3. HCI: focusing on user-centered computing. Okay, so CS160, although I complained about it a lot, was actually enjoyable. And super exciting because it cross-pollinated with my sociology research methods course. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d mind doing some high-level research, much like how a friend of mine is researching with the <a href="http://bid.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute of Design</a> doing human-centered computing.<br/>
4. Art school: okay, this has actually warranted nothing but a passing thought (side note: in HS I actually somewhat considered applying to an art school).</p>

<p>Job Options: This may be more likely to happen in the near future.<br/>
1. HCI/UI/UX: in the software industry, user interface design and implementation actually accounts for about 50%, if not more, of the total work put into a product. Interface engineers are becoming more and more important as applications become more prevalent in the 21st century.<br/>
2. Software engineering: Code monkey. The scale of this field is ginormous, from  end-user applications to huge enterprise apps.<br/>
3. Web design/development/engineering: FAQQLY was my first serious foray into the web development/engineering world. I love it. I seriously do. All &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; buzzwords aside, things that excite me about webdev are the emergence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">services</a> and the relatively undiscovered social applications of the Net. <br/>
4. Graphic/New Media designer: Working with art, design, illustration,
type, photography, motion, potentially 3D. Less code, more pretty. I actually wanted to do this right out of HS, but these days I&rsquo;m seeing it more of a hobby. Hopefully over winter break I can get some new stuff done here.<br/>
5. Advertising agency: haha putting this out there for fun, but what if the mass comm major actually counted for something?</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m done coding for the semester. Final count: 170+ hours on 162 project, ~70 hours on 160 project. My poor eyeballs.</p>
