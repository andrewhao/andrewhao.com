  <div class="entry-content"><p>Next week, in its entireity, is going to be a fantastic train wreck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve held out for a bit on the whole podcast craze, but I think I&rsquo;m relenting. So my cell phone has the ability to play MP3s, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the UI capabilities to (easily) add multiple songs to a playlist. So lately I&rsquo;ve just been downloading podcasts (currently listening to <a href="http://www.scissorkick.com/">Scissorkick</a>), cuz they save me the hassle of fumbling around for buttons on my phone. It&rsquo;s a control/simplicity tradeoff.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTqk5W5_LkY">in honor</a> of Facial Hair February (this is legit), a couple brave souls and me are embarking on a journey to, well, grow our our facial hair for the month of February. Think of it as a celebration of hair. On the face.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;edit<br/>
I have never felt as much a traveler as I do now, longing for home (in the metaphorical sense).</p>

<p>I still really want to be a graphic designer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mike&rsquo;s been having a bad week. You can read it in the grim lines set in his jaw and his listless stare.</p>

<p>Thursday, he&rsquo;s riding his bike at night when his chest pains hit. He blacks out and next thing he knows he&rsquo;s in an ambulance. He asks for his bicycle, and they tell him the police have impounded it.</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s a little angry.</p>

<p>After being released two days later, he heads over to the PD to discover that his bike is not ridable with a damaged chain and the wheels bent out of alignment (he suspects that somehow the police have mishandled his bicycle). So he sends it off to the shop to get repairs, and it sets him back forty dollars.</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s been working under a verbal arrangement with one of the workers at the food court, helping him out with cleanup duties at 6AM with an agreement to share a portion of his wages.</p>

<p>Saturday morning, Mike arrives at the food court and proceeds with his tasks. He sees his partner get paid in cash and proceed to walk out on him without saying a word.</p>

<p>Perhaps &ldquo;angry&rdquo; is the wrong word. He&rsquo;s frustrated (you can read it on his face), but he&rsquo;s silent about it. I sense this hasn&rsquo;t been the first time, nor the worst by any means. I wade through the jarring silence.</p>

<p>Dad: &ldquo;&hellip;and if you need it, I can help you with your [CS150] project. I think I&rsquo;m one of the best RTL designers out there&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose it was funny because 1) my dad isn&rsquo;t the type to brag 2) he&rsquo;s probably right and 3) he&rsquo;s dead serious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So for my International Media class (MC160) I&rsquo;ve chosen a semester focus on the Taiwanese blogosphere. It somewhat excites me, because these bloggers give a slightly different pulse on the Taiwanese people in a way that I&rsquo;m told is unrepresented in the mainstream media. I want to read about frustrations and simple joys, dissidence and politics, pop culture and resistance to the West. I want to know of everyday life in my people.</p>

<p>It pretty much intimidates me as well. Hey all you Taiwanese-Americans, tell me you have a fragmented identity. Tell me you don&rsquo;t always know if you&rsquo;re &ldquo;green&rdquo; or &ldquo;blue&rdquo;. Tell me that you turn blind eyes to what goes on back &ldquo;home&rdquo; because, well, you find following the news draining. Tell me you don&rsquo;t quite have a firm stance on any sovereignty issues. Cuz I hope I&rsquo;m not the only one. In many ways, this project is about rediscovering identity, relearning history and tapping into deep wells.</p>

<p>Here, I&rsquo;m going to post anything interesting from my research as the semester goes on. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&rsquo;s EECS150 lecture on field programmable gate arrays and hardware description languages was graced by one Prof. Randy Katz dressed in full circa-1914 naval regalia, broadsword included. I dare say that made my 10-hour school day :D</p>

<p>Always the little things.</p>

<p>Being sick isn&rsquo;t always so bad. It grows an almost-visceral gratitude for another breath.</p>

<p>And i have to add: I really like this prayer team. For very large values of &ldquo;like&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure where it came from, but towards the end of December (yes, it was probably during Urbana) I started to reexamine and deconstruct my faith. I thought it was going to be way easy (as my friend <a href="http://www.xanga.com/prayerboi516">Daniel</a> always makes it seem.. right Dan? ;D). I thought I was going to sweep for some dust bunnies and spray a little bit of Febreze. I didn&rsquo;t expect to have to climb into the basement and get my hands all muddy.</p>

<p>With the knowledge that we are known (rightly or wrongly so) for pious braggadocio, I pray it may never be so. I will catch some flak for writing this, and I&rsquo;ll humbly receive it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m examining each pillar of my faith and discerning whether it is my own or simply birthed out of habit and hearsay. It leaves me feeling shaky, especially when I critically examine a pillar and discover that all that lies in its place is a plaster mold. It&rsquo;s sad, I can honestly say that much of my faith is vicarious, depending on the experiences and confidence of others who are deeper rooted in their spiritual journeys.</p>

<p>Christine, a good friend, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/Sueyness/561282602/eugenics-for-deities-prologue.html">chides us</a> for our smugness and enclosed cultures. I&rsquo;ll take that to heart. I&rsquo;m stupefied by my blinding hypocrisy; I can be at meetings raising my hands or murmuring prayers with the realization that they are reflex actions. It manifests in the ways I can leave a Christian meeting having had my &ldquo;holy fix&rdquo; and dabble in the things I swore off hours earlier. It leaves a hollow feeling.</p>

<p>I know much of this is simply the broken human experience, but I do wonder how much of it lies in the authenticity of my faith. Simply put: I haven&rsquo;t grown up. Sometimes I get frustrated and have these revisionist urges to write off my entire early spiritual history as shallow and fraudulent. I confess; I am very good at playing grown-up roles, but inside I lack this vitality, these &ldquo;springs of living water&rdquo; that Jesus promised.</p>

<p>Yes, it has crossed my mind to write off God&mdash;more often than you would think. But I cannot, for the thread of these two things holds me fast: I am broken. I need God. It is more in my heart (or in my stomach) than it is in my mind. It is silently, undeniably, urgently there.</p>

<p>That is what I know. Sometimes that is all I know. But it is enough to push me on in this journey.</p>

<p>I can resonate with Moses, who asked God &ldquo;show me your glory,&rdquo; refusing to leave otherwise. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking. God, I&rsquo;m here in this ditch, having dug a whole lot deeper than I had intended to. I can&rsquo;t see you all the time. But I desperately want to. Show me where you are. Show me who you are. Build up my mind to study, examine and know. Tune my heart to taste, listen and see.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to start again at the basics. I&rsquo;d like to savor the Gospel (a diamond) in its full reconciling beauty. I&rsquo;d like to be rendered speechless at lavished Grace. I&rsquo;d like to wrap my mind around the fullness of G-d in love, in wrath, in justice, in fatherhood.</p>

<p>I am thankful for all of you. I remember my <a href="http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/563743530/ten-months-and-fifteen.html">last season</a> of dryness and how you responded by listening, praying, and walking with me. God was faithful, and your love (His own) got me through. I need to ask the same from you now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure Jesus spoke to me the other day. James says,
Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ll struggle. And I&rsquo;ll ask. And I&rsquo;ll have to know that God, who &ldquo;begins in [us] a good work is faithful to finish it&rdquo;. I cannot possibly add anything more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have nothing earth-shattering to report, only that today in lecture I managed to miss the &ldquo;d&rdquo; key and typed out &ldquo;emocracy&rdquo; &mdash; a word which certainly expresses my full subconscious wit (oh come on, don&rsquo;t tell me it hasn&rsquo;t ever happened to you). Usage: Hundreds of kids wearing Keds&mdash;this Dashboard concert is such an emocracy.</p>

<p>I also managed to get sick on the very last day of break and it seems like my health is on a negative trajectory. The optimist in me sees it as a chance to build up those antibodies. And a chance to stock up on candy.</p>

<p>In geek news, I nearly managed to wipe out all of my data yesterday night, thanks to a botched Ubuntu installation that apparently messed with my partition tables and didn&rsquo;t have the manners to put things back where it found em. After sweating bullets and doing a few good hours of research, I slapped together a <a href="http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page">SystemRescueCd</a> and rescued three partitions from the big bad jaws of Entropy.</p>

<p>I did manage to get that Ubuntu install finished. I&rsquo;m currently running a dual-boot XP/Linux OS configuration on my desktop, with an additional copy of XP running in a VMWare  virtual machine in Linux. The plan is to use Linux primarily for school+work+email, with a virtual instance of XP for things like my Yahoo Widgets and Palm conduits. Hardcore Windows apps (such as Adobe Creative Suite apps) will require me to log into the native instance of XP (I hope to do this as little as possible).</p>

<p>And finally, we at the <a href="http://www.porkbuns.net">Porkbuns Initiative</a> have a slick teaser for you to look at, thanks to <a href="http://hsiufan.eats.porkbuns.net/2007/01/22/comingsoon/">Hsiufan&rsquo;s tinkering</a> last night. What do we actually do? That&rsquo;s for you to find out.</p>

<p>This will be the most academically rigorous semester I&rsquo;ve ever taken. Bring it on, Powers-That-Be.</p>
