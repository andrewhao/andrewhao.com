  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The photos that almost weren&rsquo;t</h3>

<p>So do you see those photos I just uploaded? Let&rsquo;s just say that getting them online came at a price. So the story is that because I was so busy editing photos on the computer, I lost track of time (strangely enough, that&rsquo;s the story of my life). We had a frenzied-yet-hilarious adventure checking out of the hotel, miserably dragging our luggage to Paddington station in the rain, and nearly missing the Heathrow Connect train to Heathrow because I was hungry (hey, I really was!) and needed to grab some breakfast.</p>

<p>Then in Dubai as I&rsquo;m uploading them to the blog, we nearly miss our boarding call. As we&rsquo;re sprinting to the terminal, bags flailing about us, I see my life pass before my eyes, capped by a slow-mo montage of Sarah destroying me with her fists or her glare (equally horrible fates). Luckily, we just shared a good chuckle. If we missed our flight(s), however, I&rsquo;m sure the outcomes would be much different.</p>

<p>So, please do enjoy the photos. If you&rsquo;d like to see more, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andrewhao">keep track of my Flickr stream</a> through the trip, provided I survive that long.</p>

<h3>Heading to Maun, Botswana</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re currently staying in Johannesburg for the night at a really cool guest house the mission referred us to. The weather&rsquo;s nice and balmy here (they say it&rsquo;s really weird weather for this place… normally the place would be an oven). The neighborhood here is relatively upscale, more reminiscent of a strip mall straight out of California. There&rsquo;s also a bit of a jarring transition as we notice the power dynamics between the whites and African nationals here in this neighborhood. That, and we&rsquo;re pretty much the only Asian people around, so we do attract our fair share of looks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m definitely a bit nervous now as I think about arriving tomorrow. What are the nationals like, or the staff at LBOM? What&rsquo;s the weather like? Will I be able to make friends? How do I feel about being Taiwanese-American in this context? A software engineer? Will I feel useless (my friend Alvin says yes, absolutely)? I think there&rsquo;s just a lot of questions that are floating in my head and I need peace about.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s a bit nerve-wracking, I&rsquo;m definitely at peace. Some tough things have come up this week, and as Sarah and I press onward I&rsquo;m more convinced that we can trust Jesus to keep being good.</p>

<h3>Oh yeah, my luggage broke and hilarity ensued</h3>

<p>So I forgot to mention how my carry handle on my suitcase snapped en route from SFO to London. Which caused us problems today when we were scrambling to Paddington Station, because I was trying to jury-rig a contraption to drag the suitcase while maintaining a high rate of speed. Sarah has diagrammed this for us:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarahlam.andrewhao.com/botswana2009/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-6.png" alt="A broken suitcase." /></p>

<p>&ldquo;this is a picture of what andrew looked like while we were going to paddington station. it was hilarious how miserable and awkward he looked!&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These past couple of days in London have been a blast. Yes, we know we&rsquo;re on a missions trip to Africa (yes, we&rsquo;re on the wrong continent), but whoa, Jesus gave us a good gift in seeing one of the coolest cities on the planet along the way, too. By the way, did you hear of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100174144&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1004">snowstorm this week</a>?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone, I’m stoked to be leaving so soon! I’ve been telling people that I’m feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. Excitement to be embarking on such an adventure and nervousness because, well, who knows what I’ll find in store? I’m wondering whether this trip turns out to be a huge, life-changing experience or if this trip has more subtle effects in my life.</p>

<p>The other day, a friend was praying over us that we’d see this trip as a “signpost” in our lives. It was a good reminder to me to know that the significance of this trip is to give me just enough information to make the next step. I think that’s particularly pertinent in the confusion of this life stage when I really want to see the entire path from beginning to end. I’m learning to simply trust what’s been revealed to me. When I’m tempted to think of this waypoint as the destination, I’m reminded these signposts continue to appear through our lives point us toward Christ. And suddenly I’m not so fearful anymore, because I know our Father is faithful to show me just what I need to know at the right moment.</p>

<p>I’m definitely thankful to have you all praying for us and supporting us. Your words of encouragement and interest in our trip have really helped me see this trip as a “sending” action by our community, instead of “Sarah and Andrew’s trip.” That’s pretty cool, and I’m really glad to have you with us. We’ll be praying for you too; please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any prayer requests.</p>

<p>For those of you who are curious, we fly out from SFO on Monday (Feb. 2) at 1:15PM. We’ll be spending about 2 days sightseeing in London, after which we’ll continue on our way to Botswana.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, let&rsquo;s start packing. I&rsquo;m just sitting here in my room wondering <em>where the heck do I start?</em> How much space do I have in my luggage, do I have my passport, <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/global/stations/68032.html">what&rsquo;s the weather like over there</a>? Oh shoot, thunderstorms! Jacket, rain jacket, where is the jacket…</p>

<p>Passport, can&rsquo;t forget the passport. Do I need a travel power transformer? Soft suitcase or hard suitcase… I&rsquo;m afraid the hard suitcase will crack. Or the soft suitcase will… let all our stuff get crushed. Meds! Oh, I&rsquo;ve gotta start taking those malaria meds. Can&rsquo;t wait for the vivid dreams to kick in (I&rsquo;ll keep you posted if anything of that sort happens).</p>

<p>Last night my mom emailed me, asking me if I&rsquo;d started packing yet. &ldquo;Do it earlier, and you will be free from stress,&rdquo; she told me. Mom, I knew I should have listened to you!</p>

<p>Oh, before I resume all the craziness, please let us know if you&rsquo;d like to be on our prayer update mailing list, or if you&rsquo;d like to receive our prayer packet. You can do so by leaving a comment on this blog, or emailing/Facebooking/calling Sarah or myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When people hear that I&rsquo;m going to Botswana, the questions I hear the most are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Whoa, is it safe there?</p></li>
<li><p> What will you be doing?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>To which I answer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Yeah, Botswana&rsquo;s safe. It&rsquo;s politically and economically as stable as South Africa.</p></li>
<li><p> I may be doing multimedia/communication work with <a href="http://lovebotswana.org">Love Botswana</a>. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what this is, but I suspect it could have to do with <a href="http://www.lovebotswana.org/departments/studio7.html">Studio 7</a>, the organization&rsquo;s radio broadcasting ministry. I really don&rsquo;t know in what capacity I&rsquo;m going to help out with, so it could be in everything from audio production/mixing/mastering to sweeping the floors.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Even though Sarah and I have this ideal idea of how we could fit in or how our skills can be used, I think we&rsquo;re both preparing to go in real humbly and help out in the big things and little things.</p>

<h3>So why are you going?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m coming alongside Sarah, who&rsquo;s planned to come on this trip for a long time. It&rsquo;s technically a &ldquo;scouting trip,&rdquo; which means that we&rsquo;re going to get a big picture overview with how the organization runs and to better see how we can fit in. It&rsquo;s an intermediary trip for those who are interested in possibly coming on board for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>To back it up even further, I knew that Africa was a big part of Sarah&rsquo;s dreams for her future when we started dating. Which wasn&rsquo;t easy because I couldn&rsquo;t see myself in Africa… I had plans to join the industry doing whatever geeky, nerdy, software engineering gig I had prepped myself for at UC Berkeley. It&rsquo;s been an interesting time as we&rsquo;ve progressed in our dating relationship, because we had to talk about the possibility of God calling Sarah and myself different directions: to Africa and to the States.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a whole &lsquo;nother talk for another time, but I think the conclusion I&rsquo;ve come to is: live or die in the States or Africa, whether I get to experience life overseas on mission or stateside on mission in the workforce, I recognize that a heart treasuring and compelled by the Gospel is far more important than whether I get to be labeled as &ldquo;missionary&rdquo; or &ldquo;engineer.&rdquo; And so may my heart be set by that one passion: to know and love Jesus deeper and deeper, to die to myself daily, to have my  heart changed and moved by the things that move the heart of God.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Thanks,</strong> everybody who wished me at happy 23rd birthday. It was pretty swell :) I think it meant a lot to me especially as I&rsquo;m going through this strange, loopy transition period in my life. There&rsquo;s just been so much change in my life I&rsquo;ve been hesitant to write about it because it somehow doesn&rsquo;t seem right to put it to paper until it&rsquo;s been all done and sorted through. Well, today I realized that that day won&rsquo;t be coming for a long while&hellip; and it&rsquo;s time to start reflecting.</p>

<p><strong>22 was a year of endings</strong>&mdash;As I said goodbye to several close friends and finished my last final, as I left a community I loved and as I said goodbye to my parents as they moved to Shanghai, I realized that I was mourning. As much as I like to say that I anticipate growing up and moving forward, I&rsquo;m only starting to come to terms with the part of me that wants to cling onto the past.</p>

<p>Things are changing. I&rsquo;m <a href="http://sarahlam.andrewhao.com/botswana2009">taking off for Botswana</a> in week. When I get back, I&rsquo;ll be starting a new job. I&rsquo;m going to have to start looking for housing in SF or the East Bay. I&rsquo;ve been in between churches and communities and friends for far too long. I&rsquo;m in this weird in-between state between kid and adult, and I&rsquo;ve never felt more lost.</p>

<p><strong>23 will be a year of formation</strong>&mdash;I&rsquo;m talking more in terms of vision, disciplines, habits and character. I&rsquo;m anticipating that in this liminal state I&rsquo;m going to find opportunities to have my vision sharpened, my character tested, my habits and disciplines proven in the furnace of this hazy post-college life. It sounds lofty, but let me tell you, the challenge has me quaking in my proverbial boots.</p>

<p><strong>In the meantime</strong>, I&rsquo;m being reminded of the things that <em>have</em> been constant in my life: the love of my family, deepening friendships with old buddies, a <em>super </em>sweet girlfriend who never lets me forget the promises of a good Father in my life, and the gentle heart of the Father himself.</p>
