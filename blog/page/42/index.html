  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>jack lei&rsquo;s link: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=bloc/040316">ESPN Writer&rsquo;s Bloc</a><br/>
HOW DO YOU IMPROVE UPON PERFECTION?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the NCAA Tournament might be the single greatest &ldquo;event&rdquo; in all of sports &mdash; and, even if it&rsquo;s not, it certainly belongs in the argument. But the Writers&#8217; Bloc, as a group, has never been known to take &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for an answer.</p>

<p>How do you make &ldquo;the greatest&rdquo; even greater? Here are a few suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Lipsyte:</strong></p>

<p>To give those Cinderellas more of a chance at the dance, how about awarding them points they can add to their score one time on any game in the tournament. (They have to declare intent before the start.)</p>

<p>1 point if no member of the team drives an Escalade.</p>

<p>2 points if no member of the team has ever served time for rape.</p>

<p>3 points if no member of the team drives a Hummer.</p>

<p>4 points if no member of the team has ever been convicted of rape.</p>

<p>5 points if no illegal drugs are dispensed by a certified weight coach.</p>

<p>6 points if the team has never disappointed the spread.</p>

<p>7 points if the coach makes less than the university president.</p>

<p>8 points if the school doesn&rsquo;t pour Coke or Pepsi.</p>

<p>9 points if the school doesn&rsquo;t dress Nike, Reebok or Adidas.</p>

<p>10 points if no member of the team has ever been arrested for rape.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Adelson:</strong></p>

<p>Bring back the original version of &ldquo;One Shining Moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Tom Friend:</strong></p>

<p>Let everybody in, for free, to first-round games. Because, usually, there&rsquo;s no ambiance! A team like Maryland just played three heart-throbbing games at the sold-out ACC tournament. But when they play UTEP Thursday in Denver &mdash; at 10:40 a.m. local time! &mdash; in front of 350 people &hellip; they&rsquo;re gonna think it&rsquo;s a CYO game.</p>

<p><strong>Chuck Hirshberg:</strong></p>

<p>Pop quizzes.</p>

<p>At random intervals in each game, the referee should call time and summon the leading scorer from each team to center court. Both players should then be asked a simple geometry question &mdash; nothing to trip them up, just a little demonstration of the value of a college education in this, the wealthiest, most powerful civilization in history.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The radius of this jump circle is two feet, 7 inches. What is its circumference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that a player should be found unable to solve such a simple problem, he would, of course, be removed from the game. What&rsquo;s more, his team would have to forfeit all the points he&rsquo;d scored. But I&rsquo;m sure that would never happen, because I cannot remember ever hearing a coach at the Big Dance admit that his program could stand even the slightest improvement in academics.</p>

<p>In the same spirit, the possession arrow should be eliminated. Whenever there&rsquo;s a tie-up, a blackboard should be wheeled onto the court and an algebra problem chalked onto it. The player who solves the problem fastest gets the ball. In the unthinkable event that neither player is able to solve it, the game must be immediately cancelled and everybody has to go back to class, including the fans. That way, young people won&rsquo;t get the mistaken idea that our nation values festivals of sport and wagering more than education.</p>

<p><strong>Tim Keown:</strong></p>

<p>The Color-Commentator Shock Collar.</p>

<p>It zaps the speaker every time he blindly attributes a player&rsquo;s achievement &mdash; shot, pass, rebound, defensive play &mdash; to the coach&rsquo;s genius.</p>

<p><strong>Ralph Wiley:</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share the patent on this one with Tim. We can call it the &ldquo;Ke-Wil-Der-Ring Device.&rdquo; Or, not.</p>

<p>Another idea would be to send Billy Packer backward in time, back into an episode of &ldquo;The Twilight Zone,&rdquo; or ESPN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Timeless,&rdquo; where Billy, magically and somewhat luckily, hits two jump shots against St. Joe&rsquo;s to send Wake Forest to the Final Four, where Billy then gets the crap kicked out of him, time after time, every single semifinal game, one after another after another, by Earl Monroe, of crosstown Winston-Salem State, and coach Bighouse Gaines. How do we get Billy to go for it? We lock him in a closet and pretend.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick Hruby:</strong></p>

<p>Ban Duke. Seriously.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>dah.. i hate this superficiality. more and more i&rsquo;m getting wrapped up with what&rsquo;s on the outside.. but since when was it the outside that mattered? <em>melt away this heart of stone</em>.</p>

<p>genuinity, that&rsquo;s what we need.<br/>
to state it in laymen&rsquo;s terms: don&rsquo;t be frontin&#8217;. werd.</p>

<p>speaking of ghetto gangster talk, i look back on my 7th grade days and can&rsquo;t help but laugh.. hahahaha i remember when i used to log onto AIM to my five-person buddylist with a profile that contained some G-rated rap lyrics cuz i wanted to be cool, you know. and i used to AIM slang like a loose cannon: &ldquo;dun u think dis is so kewl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>absolutely, Seventh Grade Andrew. ah, the good old days. i&rsquo;ve got some repressed loser-status junior high memories just waiting to get out, i&rsquo;ll post more about them at a later date.</p>

<p>and the hair: by Mandate of Mom, the &lsquo;fro is taking another two-month hiatus while i walk around campus feeling bald and silly (it&rsquo;s actually still relatively long). &#8216;till then, i&rsquo;m trying to grow a goatee (going for the youth pastor look) but failing miserably. too bad all i got is, as daniel lui put it, &ldquo;short asian stubble&rdquo;. maybe it&rsquo;ll give me a gen-X look, or perhaps the punk rawker look, but probably just a lame look. hm, looking idiotic, it sure beats superficiality.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>yeah yeah yeah, i sprained my ankle a day ago as per tradition (it&rsquo;s
not a season until andrew&rsquo;s committed bodily harm to himself =)
i&rsquo;m going to be limping around school for the next couple of days, but
its not too bad. it&rsquo;ll heal and i&rsquo;ll be on my feet again.. literally.</p>

<p>my mom&rsquo;s getting used to these injuries. i limped in the house, she
took one look at it and asked &ldquo;do you need to see a doctor?&rdquo; to which i
replied of course not, and she just shrugged and got me some ice. ah,
thanks mom for not freaking out.</p>

<p>seven+ hours of sleep each day, and i feel so good. this is the way it
should be =) it&rsquo;s at least double of last year&rsquo;s sleep average, which
leads me to believe that surviving last year was a miracle in itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Prestigious University, USA</strong></p>

<p><strong>To Whom It May Concern:</strong></p>

<p>I regret to inform
you that I will no longer be taking the community college math course
Iï¿½ve indicated on my previously submitted application. If you would be
so kind, strike its name out of the record with Sharpie ink on page 3
(ï¿½MATH001C-61ï¿½, if you would).</p>

<p>Please understand,
itï¿½s not because I couldnï¿½t understand the material. Itï¿½s simply
because Iï¿½m not superhuman, contrary to what all my transcripts, school
reports, teacher recommendations and extracurricular activities would
have you believe.</p>

<p>Please understand, I
had a rough night last night, the majority of my sleep occurred in
between third and sixth period (I have vague recollections on what
happened in between those classes). The flu or cold or cough (or
whatever it is) isnï¿½t helping my body out either. So when I
miraculously made it back from school this afternoon in one piece, I
hope it is understandable how I was able to head straight to bed and
sleep through two straight hours of alarm clock cacophony. By the time
I had awoken and realized it, it was already too late: the test tonight
was already in effect.</p>

<p>Then again, itï¿½s
perfectly unacceptable how I left my math homework unattended to for
much of the week, how I forgot to buy a math book until the third week
of class, how I, honestly, didnï¿½t care to learn Calculus C. Thatï¿½s not
the kind of student you would want in your university, and I can
perfectly see that. I wonï¿½t mind a rejection letter or three. Really.</p>

<p>In fact, attached to
this document is a list of Andrewï¿½s Greatest Failures, ranging from
being a laughable Chinese school student (dropping out two years ago),
an injury-prone runner (unimproved since ï¿½01), an even more laughable
piano player (dropped out two years ago, one mere year from completing
the program), and now, freshly added, is the title of ï¿½Math Class
Dropout.ï¿½ Grade F, they would say.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;d understand, Andrew Hao is not
what his transcript says he is. Hiding behind every flawless
application is a flawed individual hoping not to be seen. Well this is
equivalent to doing jumping jacks in a birthday suit. Iï¿½m okay with
that, maybe it was about time Iï¿½ve failed. You just canï¿½t hide from the
awful truth. Iï¿½m sorry this had to be such a stinker.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
_Andrew Hao</p>

<p>_</p>
