    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/8688066540/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8688066540_7aa44150a0.jpg" alt="RBO @ the Oakland Running Festival" /></a> Some RBO youth take off at the start line.[/caption]</p>

<p>One thing I like about volunteering with RBO is the chance to meet up with kids from all different parts of Oakland. This year I was paired up with S, a kid from the Fruitvale district attending a local charter school just a few blocks from me.</p>

<p>S is a soft kid, a quiet kid. He isn&rsquo;t quick to volunteer himself, so our runs consist of me talking a lot, or asking him questions, and him politely answering them.</p>

<p>Our worlds are different &mdash; I grew up in wealthy Saratoga, where our biggest concerns were about our GPAs, studying for the SATs, or when we&rsquo;d inherit our parents' cars. S grew up in the hood, where everybody around him is gang-affiliated. Every Saturday morning at seven he jumps on two buses and comes out to our workouts on the south end of the lake by himself.</p>

<p>His best friend is Z, a slender Mexican-American kid like S, who became fast friends at their current school. Z has already developed the qualities of a young ringleader &mdash; brash, handsome, funny, a friend of trouble, and still hesitant and vulnerable behind his persona in a way that thirteen-year olds are.</p>

<p>Our workouts together would consist of the two friends running together, and Z volunteering uninvited facts about his friend: &ldquo;Did you know that S is the handsomest guy at school. He&rsquo;s a player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>S: (chuckles to himself)</p>

<p>Z: &ldquo;Him and me stopped being friends because he was seeing this girl, and I told him that she was trouble but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Oh yeah? What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talk about her at length.</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the deal with you guys now? You&rsquo;re still friends right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Z: &ldquo;Yeah, I went away and wrote him a letter and said I still wanted to be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two weeks later S reports back to me: I&rsquo;ve broken up with that girl, Z was right.</p>

<p>And then he tells me he&rsquo;s dating someone else now, her friend. I laugh.</p>

<hr />

<p>What&rsquo;s it like when everyone around you is living a grit-filled life? When cop cars and sirens and gunshots are your common reality?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me and my sister are close&rdquo; S says, &ldquo;but she protects me&rdquo; &mdash; her sister was jumped into a gang two years ago (I am surprised to learn she is only 14).</p>

<p>They are close, but so far apart. S has resolved to keep his head up and out of gangs, but his sister is deep in gang life. They&rsquo;re close, they fight, yet they love each other. He tells a story of nearly getting jumped himself, but for the protests of his sister, was let go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you stay out of the gang scene?&rdquo; I ask him.</p>

<p>He shrugs. &ldquo;They kind of know you&rsquo;re so-and-so&rsquo;s sister, and won&rsquo;t bother you.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>On one of our runs, Z and S were running together when S blurts out, &ldquo;Z once made me swallow a staple&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? How did that happen?&rdquo; I ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He dared me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Z&rsquo;s eyes twinkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It got stuck in my throat and I got scared and I had to go to the hospital&rdquo;, S says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst part was at the hospital, when I had to talk to his mom.&rdquo; Z shudders. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hella scary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>S just laughs.</p>

<hr />

<p>On our Oakland Half Marathon run this year, S and I were running past the West Oakland entrance to the Port, and I was talking to him about all the things we could see if we went over the bridge &mdash; Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, the Crucible, Brown Sugar Kitchen. &ldquo;Have you seen those things before?&rdquo; I ask. He responds no.</p>

<p>A half mile passes in silence, and then he volunteers, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many things I haven&rsquo;t seen&hellip; it&rsquo;s tough to see past all the violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We run a bit more in silence.</p>

<hr />

<p>S and I run a steady, paced half marathon together, and you can see his spirits rise as he pushes through his pain to get across the finish line, tired and happy. Z is somewhere behind us, having cramped up but he finishes too. And I&rsquo;m overcome with pride for S and what he&rsquo;s fighting for in his life.</p>

    <id>http://andrewhao.github.io/andrewhao/blog/2013/01/01/what-i-did-in-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Competitively, this was a good year. I <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/03/15/already-and-still-not-yet/">ran a 3:05 PR</a> at Napa (yay!), but missed Boston by seconds (argh).</p>

<p>I was <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/05/07/seasons-shift/">frustrated with my plantar fasciitis</a>, but that gave me an opportunity to go into the swim and the bike and there were a lot of good memories doing long bike rides: Mt. Diablo + Mt. Tam with Bruce and friends. I also learned to swim in open water! Did my first <a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2012/07/15/golden-gate-tri-recap/">Olympic tri</a>, with a crazy current. Got a few friends to do a Tri for Fun. Come October, the PF began clearing out and I started hitting the trails again :)</p>

<p>2013 will be the year I attempt my first <a href="http://www.ar50mile.com/">50mi race</a>, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the training runs on the trails. I think I&rsquo;ll end up doing a half-Ironman in there somewhere. And perhaps another attempt at Boston in the fall. Nate&rsquo;s going to be training for Western States, and I figure if I run with that guy enough I should be in good shape&hellip;</p>

<p>2012 was the year I started getting serious about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/andrewhaophotography">photography</a>! I&rsquo;m finding that I&rsquo;m learning a lot more about the craft. Figuring out the technical details is important, but more than that, it&rsquo;s about working with subjects, making them feel at ease. It&rsquo;s about finding light and keeping your eyes open always and going with your gut. It&rsquo;s about taking risks and trying new poses and settings. Wedding-wise, it&rsquo;s about planning, preparation and being on your toes. I have a lot to learn still, and I&rsquo;m excited about 2013&rsquo;s new assignments.</p>

<p>Wejoinin was kind of on the back burner but Hsiu-Fan and I are nearing the completion of a Rails 3 upgrade. More on that soon on my <a href="http://www.g9labs.com">technical blog</a>.</p>

<p>I took trips to Portland, LA, and even South Carolina.</p>

<p>I went to more than a few weddings and saw quite a few friends get hitched. Congratulations!</p>

<p>And&hellip; I started dating again. The feeling&rsquo;s a little surreal, but I like her a lot :)</p>

    <link href="http://andrewhao.github.io/andrewhao/blog/2012/07/15/golden-gate-tri-recap/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-15T11:17:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://andrewhao.github.io/andrewhao/blog/2012/07/15/golden-gate-tri-recap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of last month, Nate, Bruce and I did the <a href="http://trifreaks.com/golden-gate-triathlon/">Golden Gate Triathlon</a> together. This was only my second triathlon ever (after last year&rsquo;s <a href="http://onyourmarkevents.com/TriForFuninfo.htm">Tri for Fun</a>), and I intended to train hard for this sucker.</p>

<p>Given my plantar fasciitis, this was slow going. Fortunately, this gave me a lot of opportunities to focus on bike and swim: long bike rides with the Regen cycling crew, open water swims with Nate in Alameda and Jeff every week in the DeFremery and Lions pools.</p>

<p>The course was: 0.93 mile loop a little off the Crissy Field beach. Then an epic 25 mile bike ride up and down from the Crissy Field Warming Hut lot, up over the Golden Gate Bridge parking lot entrance and down Lincoln (past an __epic view of the coast) and then back &mdash; six times. Finally, a 6 mile run out and back over the Golden Gate Bridge. It goes without saying that the views were generally epic.</p>

<h2>Swim</h2>

<p>We huddled up by the beach and listened to the race director describe the course. Two loops around three buoys.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576017804/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7576017804_d7abb3047d.jpg" alt="Prepping for the swim" /></a> This photographer knew what s/he was doing.[/caption]</p>

<p>Wetsuit: I got a month rental at Sports Basement in early June. That sucker chafed at my neck a LOT. Remember next time to Body Glide it up. I was surprised at how buoyant the suit was. I also need to work on my swim technique. I pop up too often to look, when I could keep my head down and do a few more strokes before I take another look.</p>

<p>The plot got interesting when we saw the first wave of women jump into the water and start their wave. Within seconds, they started drifting sideways &mdash; <em>really</em> drifting &mdash; and fighting the current. I thought nothing about it, figuring that&rsquo;s just how it is when you swim open water.</p>

<p>But no, when I got in it was frickin <em>tough</em>. I rounded the first buoy, keeping up at the end of the pack when we turned the corner and bam. Treadmill status. I paddled for what I thought was ten minutes, and noticed that I had basically moved 10 feet. <em>What?</em></p>

<p>So I panicked a little. And then had to calm myself down by reminding myself two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> You won&rsquo;t drown.</p></li>
<li><p> You&rsquo;re strong enough</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I figured I needed to swim harder and started to kick a bit more and kind of mentally prepared myself to dig in and be swimming for an hour or so. But by then I had fallen <em>really</em> far behind (I&rsquo;m not that strong of a swimmer) and I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out the target buoy in the distance because I was staring into the sun.</p>

<p>Then another swimmer grabbed me and yelled for me to go back to shore. &ldquo;They cancelled the swim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I really just felt relief. Upon hitting shore folks were kind of in a daze, confused. Some were sprinting for the T1 station, so I kind of jogged on over. The tri had just become a duathlon.</p>

<p>I checked my watch and realized I had been in the water for 32 minutes and hadn&rsquo;t even made it halfway around the first lap. So good thing they cancelled the swim. I woulda been out there for a <em>long</em> time.</p>

<p>I had a horrible T1. I figured before the race I was just gonna strip the wetsuit and throw on my bike jersey. No way. Skin&rsquo;s too wet. I fought with my jersey for a couple of minutes as Bruce and Nate blew on past me. Ugh. Finally I got my jersey on and I was on my way.</p>

<h2>Bike</h2>

<p>I figured I was an okay biker, but I had made a mistake and gone on a workout the morning prior to race day. I&rsquo;d normally never do this on race day, but I figured somehow that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>But the course hurt a <em>lot</em> more than I&rsquo;d anticipated. If you weren&rsquo;t zooming down a hill, you were climbing one. There were next to no flats. And it was a bit mentally taxing keeping a count of the lap you were doing in your head. I half expected to either ride one too little or one too many laps.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576018872/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8285/7576018872_c8f37cf8e5.jpg" alt="Bike descent" /></a></p>

<p>It was kind of fun riding a loop course though. And the view down Lincoln was epic as usual. Every time I&rsquo;d pass Nate going opposite directions I&rsquo;d give him a little grunt of encouragement. Next time I&rsquo;m gonna have to catch him so I can ride with him.</p>

<p>I finished the bike ride at 1:43:14.</p>

<p>25 miles later we hit T2 and I threw on my shoes and was outta there&hellip;</p>

<h2>Run</h2>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;333&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/7576018688/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7576018688_6cb0064d91.jpg" alt="Hurting" /></a> Rocking $1 Wayfarers.[/caption]</p>

<p>I was both the most confident and the most shaky about the run. Running&rsquo;s my strength, and I knew I could crank out a 10K pretty well. But I hadn&rsquo;t run over 4 miles on a workout in months. I&rsquo;d have to trust my general cardio training on the bike to sustain me for the run.</p>

<p>We looped Crissy Field and headed up to the bridge. I didn&rsquo;t feel as much quad burn as I noticed after my first tri. I actually stopped to use the john halfway up&hellip; I drank too much on the bike!</p>

<p>I felt great on the steps going up &mdash; taking them two at a time and generally feeling springy. We hit the bridge and it became a game of catch-the-next-guy and dodge-the-tourists. There was a lot of dodging (and I nearly had a couple of close calls with unwary tourists). I felt really good dropping runners though.</p>

<p>One crazy thing happened &mdash; the runners went through a low tunnel on the way up. The girl running ahead of me smacked her head on the top of the tunnel and flew backwards and landed on her back. We stopped and grabbed medical help for her &mdash; there was a good amount of blood and it could have been bad. She was conscious though and able to talk through it though. Scary.</p>

<p>I finished the run in 43:46. Which is 7:04/mi pace, including a pee break and a quick detour to grab a course volunteer. Awesome.</p>

<h2>End</h2>

<p>I finished with an overall time of 2:28:20, placing me 10th in the race and 2nd in the Male 30-39 division (sweet! Also: they had registered me at 36 years old :D). Nate edged me out by 39 seconds at 2:27:41, and Bruce finished with a respectable 2:58.</p>

<p>Afterwards we enjoyed the postrace glow with a lot of peanut butter jelly sandwiches (glory!). And Clif bars. Then I found a cafe and had a big mocha. And took a fat nap.</p>

<p>Sweet! So I&rsquo;ve still not technically finished an Olympic-distance race, but maybe that&rsquo;ll be next time. All in all, I&rsquo;m happy with my performance, especially on the run.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>I can run!</em> I&rsquo;m on a jog on my lunch break for the first time in four months, and I want to tell it to everyone: tourists with itchy, sunstroked faces crowding Chinatown, Dan, down-cast on the street corner in front of that handmade sushi roll place, forty-something yuppies with yoga mats yelping as I dodge them by. I&rsquo;m drinking it in, the clangs of cable-car bells, the way they fade off when the car heads up the hill on California, the way the riders have a faraway look as if they&rsquo;ve seen something familiar yet mysterious (maybe it&rsquo;s warm nostalgia for things they can&rsquo;t remember).</p>

<p>Everything is beautiful: the way the buttery spires on Saints Peter &amp; Paul church melt into the sky. The easy spring in my stride, which surprises me. The pleasant shade of laurel trees on Jackson, set against Telegraph Hill. I have to hold myself back from racing other runners down the Embarcadero because I&rsquo;m liable to hurt myself again. But I race them anyways. <em>I can run! </em>I sing a song in my head; it is a simple one for which I&rsquo;ve forgotten the verse but not the refrain: <em>he who began a good work in you / will be faithful to complete it</em>. And so it goes.</p>

<p>Four miles in, I lope to the center of the divide in front of the Ferry Building and stretch below the sculpture in its center, noticing a small twinge in my heel. Easy now, I tell myself. Don&rsquo;t let it get to your head. But the endorphins take over and I feel light again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been wont to complain about how it sucks to be doing my training in the gym. Ever since I tweaked my foot I&rsquo;ve been feeling caged on the treadmill and elliptical machines. On the machines I can&rsquo;t think about anything, it&rsquo;s too stuffy and hot and I&rsquo;m always dripping with sweat. I&rsquo;m always staring at numbers, cursed numbers. It makes me remember how I hated running track in high school, and the unforgiving numbers that come with it.</p>

<p>On the flip side it&rsquo;s been breathtaking getting out and realizing that I&rsquo;ve been taking nature for granted. It&rsquo;s a gift to have your mind wander. It&rsquo;s a gift to roam over mossy earth. I ran out over the Oakland hills this morning to see a blanket of clouds glowing through the sunlight and pouring out over the hills into the Bay. I both wished I had my camera with me and was glad I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
