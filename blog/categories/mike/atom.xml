    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mike calls me out of the blue.</p>

<p>I pick up the receiver to a sonic wave of grief. They shot my baby, he wails, they took my girl.</p>

<p>You loved her a lot, I offer, the words stumbling out of my mouth.</p>

<p>I loved her like my own.</p>

<p>Her daddy passed away in November. Harry. He helped me move into my apartment, put in the down payment&hellip; now he&rsquo;s gone.</p>

<p>Wailing, the sobs come in waves. Bubbling, snorting, sniffling. Mike is a mess.</p>

<p>Listen.</p>

<p>I took Jubrille shopping just last week to get boots. Right out here &mdash; that Skechers on Bancroft? Giovana didn&rsquo;t like this one pair that Jubrille really liked oh God oh god oh gawd oh god</p>

<p>Silence from time to time&hellip; hello? Silence. Hello?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still here.</p>

<p>She was the last of 2012&hellip; I wish I was the last of 2012. I&rsquo;m done, Drew, I&rsquo;m done. It hurts so bad. Why&rsquo;d they take my baby?</p>

<p>How&rsquo;s Belinda?</p>

<p>The sobbing continues. She&rsquo;s&hellip; bad, Drew. Belinda&rsquo;s doing bad. You gotta call her man.</p>

<p>Jabrille, Gabriel, Jabrille, Gabriel &mdash; like the angel. Here&rsquo;s her picture.</p>

<p>Mike shows a video to me from his phone, taking his time to swipe through about twenty different pictures. There the image is, her room, shadowy in the afternoon, the sun filtering through dark curtains. Graduation photos, bags from various stores taped to the walls &mdash; FOOT LOCKER, FOREVER 21, H&amp;M. There is the sound of Mike choking back tears. There is a man in the room too, his arms slouched over his knees, giving Mike &amp; camera a long look.</p>

<p>Be strong Mike for my mom and my sister. Pull yourself together. You can&rsquo;t cry.</p>

<p>Giovana is shut off. Won&rsquo;t talk. Can&rsquo;t blame her. Her dad just passed too. And now her sister&hellip;</p>

<p><em>At the farewell funeral I met Giovana, who looked a lot skinnier and wider-eyed than I had imagined her being. She was only a year older than her sister, and walked shyly around the mourners, talking in side glances with her high school friends who looked pained and out of place. Some of them were smiling &mdash; whether it was the incongruity of it all, or using humor to mask deep sadness, I didn&rsquo;t know.</em></p>

<p>The candlelight vigil was last week, but oh man. It&rsquo;s gonna rain, Mike says, I gotta get there and get the teddy bears in her room.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling out of place. The Kingpin owner comes over to our table. Mike says: you hear the news. They took my daughter. Shot over New Years. The shop owner comes over and clutches Mike&rsquo;s phone loosely. Yeah. He looks concerned, then hands the phone back to Mike.</p>

<p>Everywhere I go I see girls that look like Jabrille. I stop and look at them. The other week we came out here and she bought boots at Skechers here. Right here in Berkeley.</p>

<p>Belinda says now you gotta help me raise the girls. So I say to Giovana: first thing is you can&rsquo;t go outside. Don&rsquo;t hang out with your hoochie mama friends. And she didn&rsquo;t say nothing.</p>

<p>Over our table now Mike slides over to me an open newspaper, the SF Chronicle, opened to an article about Malala, Pakistani girl who got shot by the Taliban. Read this? he asks. So sad.</p>

<p>You gotta be strong, Mike. Wait till this all blows over. I gotta be strong. I gotta be strong for Belinda.</p>

<p><em>Jubrille&rsquo;s viewing was the first viewing I&rsquo;ve ever been at, and she looked&hellip; unnatural. Plastic. There used to be a soul in there. Mike would stand over the casket and kissed her on the forehead. Justin and I stood awkwardly and waited in line and paid our respects and then, feeling a bit of displacement, we sat down in the pews and let Mike sit behind us and rattle on about his plans for the obituary. The entire scene felt unreal. Children running around, crawling under the pews, laughing. Belinda, who I finally met, was nicely put together, chatting it up with loved ones. I&rsquo;d overdressed; I had thought to dress up, but felt self-conscious in my tie and nice shoes. Walking back to the van Justin remarked to me and nobody in particular, is it not crazy that this kind of thing happens in Oakland twice a week?</em></p>

    <id>http://andrewhao.github.io/andrewhao/blog/2013/01/09/a-brother-like-me-15</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2347&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;375&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.andrewhao.com/2013/01/09/a-brother-like-me-15/2012-12-26-10-39-54/"><img src="http://www.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012-12-26-10.39.54-375x500.jpg" alt="Ran into Mike on a rainy day in Berkeley. We finally got a photo together." /></a> Ran into Mike on a rainy day in Berkeley. We finally got a photo together.[/caption]</p>

<p>Years have passed since I&rsquo;ve last written about Mike. I see him every once in awhile in Berkeley, still. I think about him from time to time &mdash; wonder how he&rsquo;s doing. I catch him out the corner of my eye the week before I leave for vacation, hanging around at Gypsy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Mike!&rdquo; I call back to him, and he turns around with a big grin on his face. The sidewalks are soaked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my birthday tomorrow&rdquo; he tells me, and I remember how close to Christmas it is.</p>

<p>We swap phone numbers. He&rsquo;s in possession of an Android phone now. &ldquo;How does this thing work?&rdquo; he asks and laughs to himself. He&rsquo;s showing me photos of himself, now taking classes at a culinary school in SF. Something about that seems incongruous to me and I chuckle inside&hellip; but Mike, well I believe he has the gumption and work ethic to pull it off. I tell him I owe him a birthday lunch, and we part ways.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Flash forward a couple of weeks, and it&rsquo;s the first Tuesday of the new year. I&rsquo;ve left on a run and Mike&rsquo;s left me a voice mail while on my run. I listen to it on the way back, and his voice is hollow, blue, grief-stricken. &ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; chokes the voice on the other end, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22288885/police-identify-girl-killed-oakland-shooting">they shot my baby girl</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>I look up the news article. Jubrille was 15 years old, wanted to be a teacher, and was on her way to the mall with her sister and another friend. The shooter was another teen.</p>

<p>OAKLAND &mdash; A pile of flowers, candles, teddy bears and farewell notes grew by the hour Monday afternoon on a quiet street in East Oakland, but they were little comfort to Mike Harris.</p>

<p>Harris, whose longtime family friend Jubrille Jordan, 15, was fatally shot at the site Sunday afternoon, was awash in tears as he surveyed the makeshift memorial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was my sweetheart. They killed my sweetheart,&rdquo; said Harris, a neatly dressed man in his 50s, as he wiped his eyes. &ldquo;What happened? I don&rsquo;t know, I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jubrille was Oakland&rsquo;s 12th child killed in 2012, and its 131st homicide victim in one of the city&rsquo;s deadliest years in recent memory.</p>

<p>&mdash;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/15-year-old-girl-gunned-down-in-Oakland-4158925.php#ixzz2HXjvynid">San Francisco Chronicle, &ldquo;15-year old girl gunned down in Oakland&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>She was also Oakland&rsquo;s final homicide of 2012. Mike picks up, and I barely make out his words through the sobs.</p>

<p>Justin hands me a photo a few weeks ago. Can you get this blown up? Mike wants it.</p>

<p>I go see Mike. What do you want it to say?</p>

<p>He thinks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rest in peace, Godfather. From your brother, Spicy Mike.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sunday, I get a call from Mike. &ldquo;Hey Drew, listen I gotta talk to you man,&rdquo; he starts. But this time, his voice is different: wearier, on eggshells. "I&rsquo;m at Alta Bates right now. My brother Wayne&rsquo;s in the hospital. He&rsquo;s on his way out."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God. What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got an infection, and it&rsquo;s been bad Drew, it&rsquo;s been bad.&rdquo; I hear some muffled voices in the background. &ldquo;But hey Drew, I gotta go now. I need your prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Truth of the matter is that when I graduated and moved away, I lost touch with Mike. It wasn&rsquo;t a sudden break, but gradual and subtle. I graduated. I went to Africa. I came back and started working. Mike stayed around.</p>

<p>Every once in awhile, I get a phone call from him. &ldquo;Hey Drew, how ya doin?&rdquo; Mike will ask. And I will tell him that I&rsquo;m at work, and I&rsquo;ll call him back. I try to remember to call him back. I really do.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mike, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He passed at 7:07.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wayne just gave up man. Drew, I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can say nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t cry no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Sarah and I show up at Alta Bates later that evening with some coffee and La Burrita. We wait for Mike in the waiting room. Soon he comes in a bit unsteadily, a boombox clutched in one hand, a thick wool beanie covering his head and ears. Slumping into the seat across from us, he leans forward and puts his head in his hands. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone&rdquo;&mdash;and exhales.</p>

<p>The details make their way out. &ldquo;I was out in Berkeley doing my thang. They had to come find me, tell me &lsquo;Mike, your brother Wayne&rsquo;s in the hospital. You gotta get over now.&rsquo; Can you believe that? They had to come find me.</p>

<p>Sarah offers Mike some coffee. Mike looks up and over&mdash;you brought that? Bless you. A deep sip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wayne had an infection&rdquo;&mdash;Mike says the name of some medical term, but I can&rsquo;t quite catch it. &ldquo;There was an infection on his insides. He was in so much pain. They say he couldn&rsquo;t hear nobody, but I was there at his side talking to him and I know he can hear me. You know? He twitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gotta tell everyone on his street that he gone now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike chuckles a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, I tell you, Wayne used to always walk by this woman&rsquo;s house in the morning. She used to ask me, &lsquo;Why does Wayne always do that?&rsquo; I say &lsquo;It&rsquo;s because he likes you!&rsquo; She says &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m married!&rsquo; and I say &lsquo;Well that&rsquo;s why Wayne always coming around when your man&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mike laughs as he relives the memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was prepared for Moms, but nothing prepared me for Wayne, you know? You&rsquo;re ready to see your momma pass, but not your own brother. Drew, I can&rsquo;t cry no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Last I heard from Mike, he was about to go in to court for his Social Security hearing. &ldquo;You gonna come, Drew?&rdquo; he asked me. I told him I&rsquo;d be there, and just to give him a call. &ldquo;Good. I just need you to say to the judge that you seen me have heart problems and take me to the hospital once.&rdquo; I tell him to have his lawyer call me. She never does.</p>

<p>Mike called the afternoon before his court date. I&rsquo;m at work, so I let the call go straight to voice mail. &ldquo;Hey Drew, it&rsquo;s Mike. Court hearing&rsquo;s tomorrow. Can you come?&rdquo; I call him right back, but alas, it&rsquo;s disconnected. All through the evening and into the next day, his number&rsquo;s still disconnected, and I wonder how his case turns out.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God got his purpose, Drew. I know that. Last night I was walking the neighborhood and I saw this shooting star. Just&hellip; <em>shoom</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Mike makes this flying hand motion&mdash;&ldquo;I saw a shooting star and it fly right over Wayne&rsquo;s house. And I knew, I just knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wayne was a grumpy guy, you know? Every time I come over he kick me right out after fifteen minutes. Say he don&rsquo;t want to see nobody. He was a hard man, but he was family ya know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s expression changes, and he puts his head down in his hands again. &ldquo;When my Moms passed, we all came together again. That was her last wish. We usually fighting and everything and sure enough, we came together. But we was fighting all over her things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My big sister give me a call one day and she says &lsquo;Mike, come down here and take some of Mom&rsquo;s stuff.&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want nothing to do with it.&rsquo; Everybody&rsquo;s over there taking and taking. I finally go down and you know what&rsquo;s left? A vacuum cleaner.&rdquo; Mike&rsquo;s face registers disgust. &ldquo;They take everything but her vacuum cleaner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sarah and I don&rsquo;t know what to say, but to look intently at him.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from Mike time and time again. He&rsquo;ll call me once in awhile and leave a voice mail message. &ldquo;Hey Drew, just thinking of you. Call me back all right? Say hi to Sarah for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t deserve a friend like Mike,&rdquo; Sarah told me last night. &ldquo;You know? Like we&rsquo;re not nearly as good as friends to him as he is to us. He has every right to disregard us as do-gooder students, but we really are his friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I try to remember to call, I swear I do.</p>

<p>Since Mike doesn&rsquo;t have a working cell phone any more, he calls me from several phone numbers, all of which I judge to be his family. One number is his sister&rsquo;s, another is Belinda&rsquo;s. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; I ask Belinda. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not doing too well,&rdquo; she replies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you talk to him?&rdquo; his sister asks, her voice cracking too, &ldquo;He really needs someone to talk to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>I met Mike on a starry evening five years ago on Telegraph and Durant. Was it March, or was it April? He was sitting on a milk carton at the time; I was a big-eyed freshman willing to talk to anybody. I met a Mike who was lost in his thoughts. &ldquo;You know what man,&rdquo; he tells me that evening, &ldquo;I miss my Moms. She passed five years ago today.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The police come knocking one day on Belinda&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s door, looking for Mike. &ldquo;I get a call from Belinda&rsquo;s daddy, saying, &lsquo;hey Mike, the police out here looking for you. You better get yourself over there and explain yourself.&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t do nothing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike and I are standing in front of the food court again. He looks haggard as he relays his story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They got me on jaywalking charges. You know those cameras they put up on intersections to catch red light runners? Two years ago they caught me jaywalking at 3AM across an empty intersection, no cars on either side. The other jaywalking charges they say they have on me they don&rsquo;t even have evidence for! Can you believe it?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike walked into the police station to see what the fuss was all about. They told him that he&rsquo;d have to pay a $400 fine, or do 40 hours of community service. Incredible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, man,&rdquo; Mike is weary. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re looking to get me on anything they can. First it&rsquo;s for sittin' on a milk crate, or playing my boombox, and now this. You know what?&rdquo; Mike lowers his voice. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re doing a crackdown. They&rsquo;re just trying to clean up, clean this place up before the holidays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every semester, the Berkeley Police rounds up the homeless in Berkeley and shuffles them out before parents picking up their students can see them. It&rsquo;s just how it works.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got a place, this church, where I know I can do my hours. But man! I can&rsquo;t believe this. And my birthday&rsquo;s coming up on the 23rd, right before Christmas. Hah!&rdquo;</p>
