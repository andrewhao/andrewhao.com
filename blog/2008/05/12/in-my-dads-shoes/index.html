<div class="entry-content"><p>I looked at my shoes today: brown loafers, a size too large on my feet. I was walking back from class, when I remembered my father and thought about his shoes. They are his; bought years ago but never worn. They are classy, with shiny brown patent leather, certainly the kind of shoes that would make a statement at any formal event.</p>

<p>My father doesn&rsquo;t wear these shoes. He wears another pair proudly, a pair of Bass loafers bought from an outlet store. He&rsquo;s worn them for seven years or so, always proudly showing them to us. &ldquo;See how long I&rsquo;ve worn them?&rdquo; he used to brag to us, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so comfortable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mind&rsquo;s eye takes me to his boyhood in Taiwan; he is playing in the grassy banks of the <em>Hsintien</em> river, dallying in the water, swimming in its clear, swift current. He has nothing to do all summer but eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_apple">water apples</a> and watermelon slices and run along the shores&#8217; silver banks.</p>

<p>He is from a poor family, but they are happy. At night they sit around the table and talk, smiling, laughing about the day&rsquo;s events. His brothers, sisters and he are all tanned, their hair shocked from the sun and heat.</p>

<p>Last year, my father told me to take these shiny loafers shoes up to school. &ldquo;You might need them for special occasions,&rdquo; he told me. They were a size too big, so I took the insoles off my running shoes and stuck them into these clunky shoes. Then they sat in my apartment by the doorway, waiting for the few special occasions that I did get to wear them: weddings, banquets and formals.</p>

<p>As a child, my father wears his shoes until the soles wear out. These shoes have lay upon the riverbanks for countless summer hours&mdash;patiently watching as my father, a playful boy, swims in the waters. They cannot afford to buy more shoes, but he doesn&rsquo;t mind. To him, they are just as comfortable as the day he received them.</p>

<p>And still, my father wears his shoes until the soles run out. It never crosses his mind to buy a new pair. Despite the insistence of my mother to get him a new pair, he stubbornly wears the same ones. To work, on vacations, in airplanes, on nature hikes, on the tennis court and along sun-soaked riverbanks.</p>

<p>I am walking back from class, wearing shiny shoes that my father hasn&rsquo;t worn&mdash;yet&mdash;when I think about him.</p>
