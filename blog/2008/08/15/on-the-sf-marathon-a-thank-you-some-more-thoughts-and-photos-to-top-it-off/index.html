<div class="entry-content"><p>Before we begin, let me say THANK YOU to all of you who&rsquo;ve contributed to the International Justice Mission cause! In the span of just two weeks, <strong>we&rsquo;ve raised over $800</strong>!<strong> </strong>Thank you for your generosity! It&rsquo;s our hope that we wouldn&rsquo;t just give and turn away, but our hearts would be more sensitized as our giving solidifies the link between our wallets and our hearts.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Another big THANK YOU to all of you who had been instrumental in encouraging me to press on in my training for this event. This event was like no other I&rsquo;ve ever been to.</p>

<p>It struck me on race day what a fraternal sport running is; everybody&rsquo;s in it together. So when we all gathered up at the starting line, strangers were giving each other pep talks, finishers walked back on the course to encourage stragglers, and a good bunch of three runners stopped running completely to come to my aid after I graciously faceplanted with a cramped calf.</p>

<p>So the weeks before, I&rsquo;d been sidelined a bit with a knee injury (tendonitis in my left knee). Therefore, I&rsquo;d been running only gym workouts for a good two weeks before race day. No long, extended distances, which led me to doubt my readiness on race day.</p>

<p>Typical marathon workouts encourage you to run four or five 20+ mile workouts in your training routine prior to racing. I had been averaging 13-14mi on my long runs in the months prior, so I was about six miles short of being a truly prepared runner.</p>

<p>Still&mdash;when the starting gun blew, I found myself in this huge sea of people. It was pretty amazing, this sheer number of crazies like me getting out there to run on a chilly morning. I also noticed some stomach pain; perhaps from the weird PowerBar formula I took an hour before.</p>

<p>The Golden Gate was WAY windier than I&rsquo;d expected, not doing much for my stomach. I ended up pacing behind guys with big muscles. I don&rsquo;t know why I did; maybe I just assumed they knew what they were doing. I took the first half pretty easy: I ran a 2:03 split (a 9:25/mi pace).</p>

<p>I started to get a bit more into race mentality on the second half. I got it into my mind to break 4 hours, so I knew I had to catch the 2:00 pacer girl (these are runners who guarantee a certain running pace). So the second half was very much a race to catch up to and pass as many people as possible.</p>

<p><strong>People I remember remembering:</strong> Big Guy with Big Muscles in a Cutoff Shirt, 2:00 Pacer Girl, Girl in Blue Shirt Who I Couldn&rsquo;t Pass The Last Six Miles, and Tony the Popular Guy in a Purple Shirt (everybody he passed was like &ldquo;Go, Tony!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey, Tony!&rdquo; to which he&rsquo;d throw up a peace sign and a million-watt grin).</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect was how hard The Wall would hit me at the 19 mile mark. We were exiting Golden Gate Park when my body told me, &ldquo;Andrew, I think I&rsquo;m done running&rdquo; and started Cramping Mode, which I hadn&rsquo;t really counted on.
The next seven miles were the Longest hour of my life, and it was essentially a lot of awkward running sprinkled with some intermittent cramps in my foot, my calf and my hamstring. They&rsquo;d usually take turns, just to keep it interesting. My mind didn&rsquo;t quite appreciate it. Spectators just laughted.</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is why I didn&rsquo;t get it in my mind to stop and take the time to stretch. I guess I was too doggone set on beating 4 hours, so I&rsquo;d be running through cramps (my body&rsquo;s <em>obvious </em>way of signaling me to stop). It helped that 2:00 Pacer Girl was in striking distance, keeping me on pace for better or worse.</p>

<p>So it completely befuddles me that despite these cramps and a fall that I&rsquo;d run my second half faster than the first: 1:58 (at a respectable 9:13/mi pace). What in the world happened there? No idea.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s just say that one of the greatest feelings in the world (well.. it&rsquo;s pretty up there) is crossing that finish line and just feeling your body scream for joy of Being Done. And is that food on those tables over there? Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be over there.</p>

<p>Major props to Tony for finishing his half marathon in style and being a great help in IJM fundraising. Of course, Sarah was as patient and amazing as ever in trucking our weary bodies all around SF that morning and afternoon.</p>

<p>All in all, a wonderful feeling, this marathon thing. Really, I&rsquo;m not crazy. I just like the feeling of moving forward, the inexorable draw toward the finish line and the charge to persevere.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s talk of running more races in the fall. Anybody interested?</p>

<h3>A Smorgasbord of Pain!</h3>
