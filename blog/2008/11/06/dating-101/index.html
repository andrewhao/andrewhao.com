<div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m going to be candid and share with you some dating lessons I&rsquo;ve learned (with Sarah&rsquo;s permission!). My buddy Jeff was right when he told me, &ldquo;Dating&rsquo;s a good way to learn how much you need grace.&rdquo; And I need boatloads of it. Here we goooo&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Transitioning from self-sufficiency to dependency</strong></p>

<p>From very early on in my life, I&rsquo;ve learned to be pretty self-sufficient. That means that I&rsquo;d always be doing things on my own, doing things on my own initiative, making things happen for myself, you get the gist of it. It&rsquo;d be totally <em>me</em> centered: I&rsquo;m going to do this, and I&rsquo;ll follow it up with that. I&rsquo;ll make my own decisions, and you can ask me about how it was afterwards.</p>

<p>Sarah and I have had our moments where I&rsquo;d show up and tell her &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m going to be doing this on Saturday&rdquo; with an implicit assumption she wouldn&rsquo;t be a part of it. She&rsquo;d feel hurt that I&rsquo;d left her out, and I realize now that I had assumed that she just wasn&rsquo;t interested in them or that I didn&rsquo;t need her help.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m learning to invite her into all parts of my life, from the boring mundane things to the big events. Even if I think I can do these things by myself, I&rsquo;m starting to learn to ask for help when I feel like I don&rsquo;t need any. When I show Sarah that I&rsquo;m dependent on her, it gives her a way to show me that she cares.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency, and how it&rsquo;s okay to not have it all together</strong></p>

<p>There was a period in our relationship where I felt incredibly insecure about us. I felt like I was losing her, I felt like I was being disrespected or I wasn&rsquo;t good enough, and there was all this crap I was going through.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how to talk about it though, so I acted the opposite of how I felt. I acted more confidently around her when inside my insecurities spoke louder. I doubled my efforts of pursuing her when really I was scared. I realize now that by acting like everything was peachy, I delegitimized communication that &ldquo;something was wrong&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I had somehow constructed this image of a super-boyfriend, who never spoke of trouble but instead slugged through hard times by the force of sheer will and corny jokes. And Sarah could see through <em>all</em> of it&mdash;and my inability to articulate how I was really feeling pushed her further away.</p>

<p>After a long, awkward and painful week, we confronted it. By finally admitting to her that things were off, we were free to finally talk about it.</p>

<p><em>To be continued!</em></p>
