<div class="entry-content"><p>It startled me because I actually felt it last night, the groaning of a city. Carlos&#8217; voice expressed it best, a wail that shook the walls: <em>Oh / how he loves us oh / how he loves us </em>and I felt like crying.</p>

<p>Tonight it was there again as we ran with the street kids. <em>Rugby boys</em>, they call them, the dirt-caked homeless kids of the city who sniff Rugby-brand glue to forget the pangs of hunger in their bellies. One of the boys has taken a liking to me and has a habit of flying at me and landing square on my back. He perches on the shoulders of another boy and launches up, up, and away&hellip;</p>

<p>I want to wail, but I can&rsquo;t be heard over the singing of men and women prophesying over the boys in Cebuano: <em>Your Father loves you; your Father has prepared a house for you where there will be no more pain</em>. <em>Hear the voice of your Father&hellip;</em> The boys are lying on the ground, resting, wrestling, festering, sweltering. They sing, too, poking each other in between refrains.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this somewhere before. A dream? A crowded traffic circle, bright casino lights, the yellow cast of a sodium streetlamp, the sweltering heat. Twenty street kids, homeless men and women, an even-larger family surrounding them, and the songs. A song, their hearts, the traffic circle, the heart of the city, the children, the heart of the Father, their songs for the Father. They sing, I weep. I&rsquo;ve had this dream once before. Do the kids dream?</p>

<p>The congregation that we are with is also praying and listening. They are bent over next to each child as they whisper into their ears. A man not much younger than I translates for me: <em>he said thank you God for healing my brother</em>, or <em>that guy said thank you God for being with me another day</em>. I look over and Eric is cradling a girl who has fallen asleep in his arms. Zach is engrossed in a conversation with an old man. Ken carries a boy on his shoulders. We serve rice and pork stew slowly. I wield my ladle with slow, measured strokes in the broth. As it disappears I panic and pray harder.</p>

<p>What is this, Jesus? Something snaps and I want to cry; it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve felt this close to the Father. A dream buried from years ago resurfaces and wrecks me tonight. The city groans where the children sleep. I strain to listen; listen, can you hear? They are being birthed. Nobody wants to hold these children. Who will name them&mdash;the boy lands on my back and knocks the wind out of me&mdash;when we leave? Hurry, the children are arriving. Come and listen to their groans. The Father is close, and he has prepared them a home in his city.</p>
