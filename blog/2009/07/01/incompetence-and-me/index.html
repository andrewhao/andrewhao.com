<div class="entry-content"><p>So I&rsquo;m cutting my hair on Sunday&mdash;no big deal, right? I&rsquo;ve been cutting my hair for the past eleven years (one mirror, one trimmer and nerves of steel) to varying degrees of success. Well&hellip; my standard of success means that after my haircut, I should a) still be recognizable as me and b) not elicit laughter (a compliment here and there wouldn&rsquo;t be bad, either!).</p>

<p>Sunday, I gave myself a pretty bad haircut. It was a really hot evening, and I was impatient to be finished. Well, buzzing trimmer in hand (with no guard), I misjudged the angle of my head and on my way up, and&hellip; <em>whoops!</em></p>

<p>In one fell swoop, I had a crater on the back of my head. Further inspection with a mirror revealed the horrifying truth: It was bad; I could give the ozone layer a run for its money. And really, all I could really do was laugh.</p>

<p>I think this was the icing on the cake to a long trial period in my life where I&rsquo;ve just realized how uncool and incompetent I am. I&rsquo;m not very suave. The words that come out of my mouth can be Shockingly Dumb. I can be forgetful, I can be insecure, I can be totally, totally awkward. I&rsquo;m a Neanderthal.</p>

<p>In short, I can fail in more ways than I ever thought I could, and I&rsquo;m not as well put together as I thought I was, and that&rsquo;s been super depressing to come to grips with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been learning the hard lessons of who I really am. I&rsquo;ve had my pride knocked around a <em>lot</em>. Between myself and Sarah, I&rsquo;ve discovered that I&rsquo;m a Total Idiot when it comes to emotions and communication and all that good stuff (who can relate?!).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made mistakes at work. I&rsquo;ve been a bad friend. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of things that just weren&rsquo;t up to par. I&rsquo;m actually not as good of a guy than I gave myself credit for.</p>

<p>But, maybe that&rsquo;s what leads to the laughing. Maybe this is just it; maybe I&rsquo;m going through the wringer to get humbled and get a fresh beginning on this post-college life. Maybe this is exactly what it feels like to know how much I need Grace, and to be at my wits&#8217; end regarding my own abilities to accomplish anything Good. And maybe there&rsquo;s that joy that&hellip; heck. Crater or no crater, I&rsquo;m loved. I&rsquo;m not that big of a deal, and that&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>

<p>I know I need God. Dang. That&rsquo;s the one thing that echoes through my mind every morning. I can&rsquo;t make it through the day without your Grace, Jesus. I don&rsquo;t care about anything else.</p>

<p>A verse, ever-quoted through this blog, is James 1:2-5. The words stumble through my lips by losers and failures like me, making them all the more powerful.</p>

<blockquote><p>2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p></blockquote>

<p>5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.</p>

<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s going to be okay. I&rsquo;m still growing. I&rsquo;m still learning to depend on Jesus.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go find myself a hat.</p>
