<p>This week at Urbana was what I needed. I think I heard what I needed to hear: echoes of the Kingdom told through businesspeople who understand that with regards to their businesses, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not about the money, but all about relationships.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s about being conscientious to how you can use business to advance the Kingdom and change lives: creating jobs, being ethical, opening doors.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been needing some sort of spiritual kick in the pants, and I think I finally feel that there&rsquo;s a door opening with regards to my future. Coming here and getting excited about using my skills and passion about software, design, programming, people&hellip; man. I think this is helping me focus where I need to be going and growing. Mentorship, discipleship, practical real-world business skills, prayer&hellip;</p>

<p>Tom Hsieh is an Asian-American tech entrepreneur whose story tells that story well. Years ago Tom went to Urbana and came away with two convictions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> God&rsquo;s heart was for the urban poor.</p></li>
<li><p> Tom did not love the poor.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Something needed to happen, so Tom decided to move into the inner city after graduation, turning down several lucrative offers and serving with a local church there. He took a part-time computer tech job with flexible hours so he could do his service there.</p>

<p>Tom was successful in what he did and his career advanced. Soon he found himself an executive at Earthlink (in its nascent startup days), where he told us stories about simply being obedient to Jesus in the workplace, living a simple life in the grind of corporate America, living a life of radical giving. Tom and his wife have committed to live at or below the median income level, so that means they give away about 80% of their income. Crazy.</p>

<p>Tom was closing a business deal over a power lunch one day: &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t real!&rdquo; he thought to himself while bringing the slice steak up to his mouth. Hanging out with the neighborhood kids and seeing their smiles? That&rsquo;s real. Being spiritually authentic and Hopeful in a world that denies it? That&rsquo;s real.  Choosing to fight greed with generosity? That&rsquo;s real.</p>

<p>Hearing stories like these this week was good for my soul. More specifically, I think I have some sort of calling to live a focused, missional life. Here. Or overseas. Who knows, and where a few years ago that was something I felt I had to fight, this time around it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s freeing.</p>

<p>Who knows, who knows. It&rsquo;s the start of a new year. New possibilities. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
