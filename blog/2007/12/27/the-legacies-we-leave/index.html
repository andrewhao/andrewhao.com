<div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s something I miss about being with my dad.</p>

<p>I have memories of just sitting in his lap waaaay back when I was a wee lad (haha). There was that security of knowing his love for me. There was that anticipation of one day growing up and being like him. Now, 15 years in the future, I think I get it.</p>

<p>My dad and I took a trip to the Big Sur coastline yesterday to hang out for the afternoon. We reminisced on how we used to take weekly family trips to the sea. &ldquo;It was really fun then,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and we could go so often; you guys didn&rsquo;t have a choice but to come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Driving Highway 1 is a little dangerous, because most drivers spend half their time looking at the expansive sea instead of the lane markers. The sea, yesterday, was particularly impressive (so I was a little nervous).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember when we went shopping for our first van?&rdquo; I ask him. I was car-crazy in the third grade. I had picked out the perfect van, a top-of-the-line Nissan Quest with all the trimmings. It was also about six thousand dollars above our budget. My dad ended up buying a bottom-of-the-line Mercury Villager with zero options, save for the air conditioning. (&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need all those options,&rdquo; he would remind me. &ldquo;You only waste money if you&rsquo;re rich&hellip; and stupid.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>My dad smiled and nodded. &ldquo;That made a big impact on me,&rdquo; I tell him. Even though my third-grade heart was crushed, he&rsquo;d taught me to differentiate between a want and a need.</p>

<p>My dad grew up poor. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t feel poor,&rdquo; he tells me, &ldquo;I was really happy.&rdquo; I grew up hearing his stories about how he used to make his own tools and toys from sticks and rubber bands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember one day my dad gave me [the Taiwanese equivalent of] 25 cents to buy candy,&rdquo; he tells me with a grin. &ldquo;That taught me grace. I got something I didn&rsquo;t deserve.&rdquo; He smiles as he remembers. &ldquo;It really made a big impact on me; I still remember it today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My grandfather is a kind man, but he wasn&rsquo;t always like that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really proud of my daddy,&rdquo; my dad tells me. &ldquo;He used to have a temper, working away in a foreign country for all those years. But as he grew older, he became kinder; he had more joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I point out how strange it is to have indirectly received a bit of Yieh Yieh through him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called a legacy,&rdquo; he tells me, and we all leave one behind.</p>

<p>Even though we grow up and we get busy, even though conversations are stilled and chances are missed, I find this time with my dad more than enough to make up for time lost.</p>

<p>We twist and turn through the highway, gaping at the coast, but never straying too far from who we are and what we leave behind.</p>
