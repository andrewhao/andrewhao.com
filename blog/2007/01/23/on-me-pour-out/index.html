<div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure where it came from, but towards the end of December (yes, it was probably during Urbana) I started to reexamine and deconstruct my faith. I thought it was going to be way easy (as my friend <a href="http://www.xanga.com/prayerboi516">Daniel</a> always makes it seem.. right Dan? ;D). I thought I was going to sweep for some dust bunnies and spray a little bit of Febreze. I didn&rsquo;t expect to have to climb into the basement and get my hands all muddy.</p>

<p>With the knowledge that we are known (rightly or wrongly so) for pious braggadocio, I pray it may never be so. I will catch some flak for writing this, and I&rsquo;ll humbly receive it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m examining each pillar of my faith and discerning whether it is my own or simply birthed out of habit and hearsay. It leaves me feeling shaky, especially when I critically examine a pillar and discover that all that lies in its place is a plaster mold. It&rsquo;s sad, I can honestly say that much of my faith is vicarious, depending on the experiences and confidence of others who are deeper rooted in their spiritual journeys.</p>

<p>Christine, a good friend, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/Sueyness/561282602/eugenics-for-deities-prologue.html">chides us</a> for our smugness and enclosed cultures. I&rsquo;ll take that to heart. I&rsquo;m stupefied by my blinding hypocrisy; I can be at meetings raising my hands or murmuring prayers with the realization that they are reflex actions. It manifests in the ways I can leave a Christian meeting having had my &ldquo;holy fix&rdquo; and dabble in the things I swore off hours earlier. It leaves a hollow feeling.</p>

<p>I know much of this is simply the broken human experience, but I do wonder how much of it lies in the authenticity of my faith. Simply put: I haven&rsquo;t grown up. Sometimes I get frustrated and have these revisionist urges to write off my entire early spiritual history as shallow and fraudulent. I confess; I am very good at playing grown-up roles, but inside I lack this vitality, these &ldquo;springs of living water&rdquo; that Jesus promised.</p>

<p>Yes, it has crossed my mind to write off God&mdash;more often than you would think. But I cannot, for the thread of these two things holds me fast: I am broken. I need God. It is more in my heart (or in my stomach) than it is in my mind. It is silently, undeniably, urgently there.</p>

<p>That is what I know. Sometimes that is all I know. But it is enough to push me on in this journey.</p>

<p>I can resonate with Moses, who asked God &ldquo;show me your glory,&rdquo; refusing to leave otherwise. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking. God, I&rsquo;m here in this ditch, having dug a whole lot deeper than I had intended to. I can&rsquo;t see you all the time. But I desperately want to. Show me where you are. Show me who you are. Build up my mind to study, examine and know. Tune my heart to taste, listen and see.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to start again at the basics. I&rsquo;d like to savor the Gospel (a diamond) in its full reconciling beauty. I&rsquo;d like to be rendered speechless at lavished Grace. I&rsquo;d like to wrap my mind around the fullness of G-d in love, in wrath, in justice, in fatherhood.</p>

<p>I am thankful for all of you. I remember my <a href="http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/563743530/ten-months-and-fifteen.html">last season</a> of dryness and how you responded by listening, praying, and walking with me. God was faithful, and your love (His own) got me through. I need to ask the same from you now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure Jesus spoke to me the other day. James says,
Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ll struggle. And I&rsquo;ll ask. And I&rsquo;ll have to know that God, who &ldquo;begins in [us] a good work is faithful to finish it&rdquo;. I cannot possibly add anything more.</p>
