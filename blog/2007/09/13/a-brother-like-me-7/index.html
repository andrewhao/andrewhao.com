<div class="entry-content"><p>Mike&rsquo;s breath sports the sour edge of alcohol. &ldquo;Had some wine at my sister&rsquo;s anniversary tonight,&rdquo; he tells me. He&rsquo;s had plenty tonight, the fumes tell me over the din of Tupac&rsquo;s <em>All Eyez On Me</em>.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s looking pretty disheveled in a secondhand jacket and a Jamaica-themed beanie. Standing still, holding up his sign above his head (&ldquo;Need some Help<em>&mdash;God Bless</em>&rdquo;), Mike cocks his head at an angle. &ldquo;Drew, I gotta talk to you mang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s stiffly staggering as he walks up the block, toward me. He&rsquo;s desperate. His cousin&rsquo;s friend <a href="http://blog.g9labs.com/2007/09/07/a-brother-like-me-6/">broke into his ATM account</a>, his Medi-Cal coverage was refused and his bills are piling up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drew.&rdquo; Mike&rsquo;s at the end of his rope. I can see it in his eyes. He&rsquo;s cornered (and it scares me). I instinctually back away.</p>

<p>His face falls, eyes squint as if to keep in tears and suddenly he&rsquo;s emotional. &ldquo;Listen, man, you gotta help me, man.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/91/237942713_6c87ef53da_t.jpg" alt="" />Mike lists off his needs. He&rsquo;s always long-winded about these things. Mike tells me about Belinda, and how &ldquo;she&rsquo;s probably gone drunk right now&mdash;<em>you wanna call her now? You wanna?</em>&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s going off on how his phone bill gonna be cut off (&ldquo;It was due on the 11th of last month, and I just pay it on this month the 8th. They cut me off tomorrow&mdash;<em>call me Drew. Call me now. See?</em>&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Mike has a cell phone bill of 57 dollars a month. I don&rsquo;t know anybody who pays 57 dollars a month for one cell phone. Why, if I had a phone plan I&rsquo;d just get a pay-as-you-go plan and pay about fifteen dollars a month. <em>What&rsquo;s he thinking?</em> He&rsquo;s so irresponsible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Drew, they deny me my medical coverage. I gotta get those heart pills.&rdquo; <em>How many you got, Mike?</em> &ldquo;I got about 70 tabs left, they last me maybe a few weeks.&rdquo; He pulls out a bottle filled with little nitroglycerin tablets and shakes a few out into his palm&mdash;&ldquo;They go stale after too long, you see&rdquo;&mdash;and begins to put them back but begins dropping tablet after tablet because his hands are shaking.</p>

<p>Mike stands up to his full height. &ldquo;Liiisten, <em>Drew</em>, you gotta help me. You <em>gotta </em>help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really irritated now. &ldquo;What do you want, Mike?&rdquo; I try to keep the tone of my voice calm but my anger is starting to come through. &ldquo;You want money, man? <em>How much do you want</em>?&rdquo; I want to take back every word I say for every reason.</p>

<p>Mike falls onto his milk crate, draped in cardboard cartons. &ldquo;I dunno mang, you just gotta help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but I egg him on. &ldquo;How much you want, man? You just want the money, right?</p>

<p>Mike doesn&rsquo;t respond.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just standing there with my anger welling up more and more inside me&mdash;<em>is that all I am? </em>I&rsquo;m feeling a little more hurt than I am angry. &ldquo;Okay, you want money? I&rsquo;ll get some to you tomorrow. When are you free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not enough for him. &ldquo;Listen Drew, my <em>phone bill</em>. They gonna cut off my <em>phone</em>. You got a couple bucks now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <em>nerve</em>.</p>

<p>Mike&rsquo;s head lulls with every syllable, the alcohol slurs his speech. He keeps rambling and I have to stop myself from walking off.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m standing, he&rsquo;s sitting. I&rsquo;m ramrod straight and he&rsquo;s rocking back and forth. I look down at him with a sore expression. &ldquo;You want money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still rambling, staring into the street, &ldquo;&hellip;and it&rsquo;s gonna end up being in the <em>thousands</em>&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>But I already know how much I&rsquo;m supposed to give Mike: enough to hurt. The last night I told Mike to meet me at 9 in the morning on the Durant sidewalk, then I oversleep with last night&rsquo;s anger still simmering inside.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s reclining on a folding chair when I walk up at 10:30AM, his boombox cradled in his lap, punching the buttons on the front panel. He turns to me: &ldquo;Hey Drew, got any idea why the CD don&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We spend a good 10 minutes punching buttons and flipping switches on the ancient boombox, to no avail. &ldquo;Batteries probably died,&rdquo; I halfheartedly suggest. The CD inside makes a pathetic attempt to spin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa! It&rsquo;s the batteries,&rdquo; he declares.</p>

<p>We make small talk for a bit. He&rsquo;s sober, and doing better than he was last night. &ldquo;I stay over at the shelter last night, then got out here early in the morning.</p>

<p>I drop some money into his cup. He stands up and beams. &ldquo;Thanks Drew. I know I can count on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I say nothing and turn to leave. I don&rsquo;t think I can come back here, not in the near future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he calls after me, &ldquo;you think we messengers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Messengers. Spreadin&#8217; the word. Disciples, apostles, is that the word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I give him a half-hearted grin. <em>I don&rsquo;t know</em>. I walk off.</p>
